Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/d4f1b06d.failed

We should set device's capabilities first, and then register it,
otherwise various handlers already present in the kernel will not be
able to connect to the device.
