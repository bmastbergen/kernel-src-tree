Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/dfb5b894.failed

Don't convert these to internal hardware tick values before storing
them.  This avoids the confusion of ethtool -c returning slightly
different values than the ones set using ethtool -C when we convert
hardware tick values back to micro seconds.  Add better comments for
the hardware settings.

Also, rename the current set of coalescing fields with rx_ prefix.
The next patch will add support of tx coalescing values.
