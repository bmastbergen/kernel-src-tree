Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/7b094063.failed

If either of the entries was missing, the driver tried to free memory
using uninitialized pointer. In addition, it was dereferencing null
pointer.
