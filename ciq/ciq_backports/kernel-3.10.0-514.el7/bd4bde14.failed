Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/bd4bde14.failed

Since commit 40767b0dc768 ("sched/deadline: Fix deadline parameter
modification handling") we clear the thottled state when switching
from a dl task, therefore we should never find it set in switching to
a dl task.
