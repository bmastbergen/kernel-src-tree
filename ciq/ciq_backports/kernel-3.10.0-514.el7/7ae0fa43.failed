Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/7ae0fa43.failed

Introduce a workqueue that will be used to run address range scrub
asynchronously with the rest of nvdimm device probing.

Userspace still wants notification when probing operations complete, so
introduce a new callback to flush this workqueue when userspace is
awaiting probe completion.
