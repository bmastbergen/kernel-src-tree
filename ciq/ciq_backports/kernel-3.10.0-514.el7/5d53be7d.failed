When I merged the OPAL support for the powernv LEDS driver I missed a
hunk.

This is slightly modified from the original patch, as the original added
code to opal-api.h which is not in the skiboot version, which is
discouraged.

Instead those values are moved into the driver, which is the only place
they are used.
