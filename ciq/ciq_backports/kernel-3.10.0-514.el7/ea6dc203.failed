Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The emulated GSI QP's send completions are generated by multiple hardware
QPs, so their completions could arrive out of order with respect to the
order their work request were submitted.

Reorder the completions by keeping a list of the posted work request and
their completions. A newly received completion from the hardware updates
the list and marks its work request as completed. However, the completions
are only reported to the client according to the list order.

In order to support that, create a new private CQ to handle the hardware
completions.
