Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/a8643e16.failed

Use appropriate firmware request header structure to prepare the
firmware messages.  This avoids the unnecessary conversion of the
fields to 32-bit fields.  Add appropriate endian conversion when
printing out the message fields in dmesg so that they appear correct
in the log.
