Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/45eb570a.failed

This path was missed when turning on the memmap in pmem support.  Permit
'pmem' as a valid location for the map.
