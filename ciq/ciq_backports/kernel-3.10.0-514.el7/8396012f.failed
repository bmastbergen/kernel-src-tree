Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/8396012f.failed

The resid is incorrectly set which can lead to unnecessary retry
attempts by the stack. This is due to resid _always_ being set
using a value returned from the adapter. Instead, the value
should only be interpreted and set when in an underrun scenario.
