Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/9dd6a064.failed

We don't catch this allocation failure because there is a typo and we
check the wrong variable.

Fixes: 14b50f80c32d ('Drivers: hv: util: introduce hv_utils_transport abstraction')
