Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

DMC version 1.06 has a known bug, where the firmware polls forever for a
port PLL to lock, if the PLL was disabled when entering DC5, which locks
up the machine. Version 1.07 fixes this, so make that the minimum
required version on BXT.
