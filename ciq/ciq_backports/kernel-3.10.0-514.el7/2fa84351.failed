Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/2fa84351.failed

When CONFIG_NUMA is enabled and node 0 is memoryless, the system
crashes because nvme_probe() sets the device->numa_node to 0 by
set_dev_node(&pdev->dev, 0), so it tries to allocate memory from node 0.
To avoid the crash, we should change the 0 to first_memory_node.
