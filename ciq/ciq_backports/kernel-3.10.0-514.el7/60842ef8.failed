The VMWare EFI BIOS will expose port 0x5658 as an ACPI resource.  This
causes the port to be reserved by the APCI module as the system comes up,
making it unavailable to be reserved again by other drivers, thus
preserving this VMWare port for special use in a VMWare guest.

This port is designed to be shared among multiple VMWare services, such as
the VMMOUSE.  Because of this, VMMOUSE should not try to reserve this port
on its own.

The VMWare non-EFI BIOS does not do this to preserve compatibility with
existing/legacy VMs.  It is known that there is small chance a VM may be
configured such that these ports get reserved by other non-VMWare devices,
and if this ever happens, the result is undefined.
