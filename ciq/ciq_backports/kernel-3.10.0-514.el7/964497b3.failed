Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/964497b3.failed

At present, both ports must be online for the device to
configure properly. Remove this dependency and the unnecessary
internal LUN override logic as well. Additionally, as a refactoring
measure, change the return code variable name to match that used
throughout the driver.

With this change, the card will be able to configure even when the
link is down. At some later point when the link is transitioned to
'up', a link state change interrupt will trigger the port configuration.
Note that despite its void-like behavior, the function was left with a
return code for right now in case its behavior needs to be altered again
in the near future based on testing.
