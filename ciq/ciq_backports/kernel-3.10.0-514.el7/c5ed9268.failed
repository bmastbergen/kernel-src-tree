Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/c5ed9268.failed

For autodetecting a previously established dax configuration we need the
info block to indicate block-device vs device-dax mode, and we need to
have the default namespace probe hand-off the configuration to the
dax_pmem driver.
