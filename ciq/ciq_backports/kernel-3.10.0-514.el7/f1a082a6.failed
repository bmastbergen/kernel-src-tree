Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/f1a082a6.failed

Allow all autoneg speeds aupported by firmware to be advertised.  If
the advertising parameter is 0, then all supported speeds will be
advertised.

Remove BNXT_ALL_COPPER_ETHTOOL_SPEED which is no longer used as all
supported speeds can be advertised.
