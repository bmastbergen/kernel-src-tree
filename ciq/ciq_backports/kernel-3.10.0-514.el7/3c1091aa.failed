Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3c1091aa.failed

__mmu_rb_remove was called in only 1 place which was a very simple
call site.  Combine this function into its caller.
