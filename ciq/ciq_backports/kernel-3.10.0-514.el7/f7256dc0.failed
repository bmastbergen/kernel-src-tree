Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/f7256dc0.failed

Rather than punt on the numa node for these e820 ranges try to find a
better answer with memory_add_physaddr_to_nid() when it is available.
