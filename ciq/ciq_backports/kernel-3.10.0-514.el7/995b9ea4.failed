Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/995b9ea4.failed

In deadline class we do not have group scheduling like in RT.

dl_nr_total is the same as dl_nr_running. So, one of them should
be removed.
