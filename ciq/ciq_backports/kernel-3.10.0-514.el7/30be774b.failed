Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/30be774b.failed

It seems the idea behind the cross-check is to prevent acquire semaphore when
there is no release callback and vice versa. Thus, patch fixes a typo.
