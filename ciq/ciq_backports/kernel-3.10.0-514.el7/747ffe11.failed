Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Use the output length specified in the command to size the receive
buffer rather than the arbitrary 4K limit.

This bug was hiding the fact that the ndctl implementation of
ndctl_bus_cmd_new_ars_status() was not specifying an output buffer size.
