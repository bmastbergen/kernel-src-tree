Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3a70fcd3.failed

He Kuang the new fixdep tool breaks cross compiling. The reason is it
wouldn't get compiled under host arch, but under cross arch and failed
to run.

We need to add support for host side tools build, meanwhile disabling
fixdep usage for cross arch builds.
