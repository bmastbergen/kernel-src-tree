The AFU version is stored as a non-terminated string of bytes within
a 64-bit little-endian register. Presently the value is read directly
(no MMIO accessor) and is stored in a buffer that is not big enough
to contain a NULL terminator. Additionally the version obtained is not
evaluated against a known value to prevent usage with unsupported AFUs.
All of these deficiencies can lead to a variety of problems.

To remedy, use the correct MMIO accessor to read the version value into
a null-terminated buffer and add a check to prevent an incompatible AFU
from being used with this driver.
