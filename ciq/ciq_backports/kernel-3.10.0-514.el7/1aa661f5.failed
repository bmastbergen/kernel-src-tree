Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/1aa661f5.failed

Make test configurable by allowing to specify all relevant knobs
through module parameters.

Do several test runs and measure the average time it takes to
insert & remove all entries. Note, a deferred resize might still
continue to run in the background.
