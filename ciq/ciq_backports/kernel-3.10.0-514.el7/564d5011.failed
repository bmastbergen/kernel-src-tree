Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/564d5011.failed

If acpi_nfit_init is called (such as from nfit_test), with an nfit table
that has more memory allocated than it needs (and a similarly large
'size' field, add_tables would happily keep adding null SPA Range tables
filling up all available memory.

Make it friendlier by breaking out if a 0-length header is found in any
of the tables.
