Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/7d2837dd.failed

The multicast/all-multicast internal flags are not properly restored
after device reset.  This could lead to unreliable multicast operations
after an ethtool configuration change for example.

Call bnxt_mc_list_updated() and setup the vnic->mask in bnxt_init_chip()
to fix the issue.
