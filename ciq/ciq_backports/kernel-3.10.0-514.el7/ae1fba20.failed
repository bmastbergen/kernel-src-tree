Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ae1fba20.failed

It's possible a request may get to the driver after the nvme queue was
disabled. This has the request requeue if that happens.

Note the request is still "started" by the driver, but requeuing will
clear the start state for timeout handling.
