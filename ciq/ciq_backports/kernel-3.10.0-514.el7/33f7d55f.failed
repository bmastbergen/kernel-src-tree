Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/33f7d55f.failed

Let firmware know that the driver is giving up control of the link so that
it can be shutdown if no management firmware is running.
