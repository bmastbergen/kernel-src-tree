Quting the relevant thread:

You're right.  For some reason I thought that usb_deauthorize_device()
would destroy the rawdescriptor structures (as mentioned in that
commit's Changelog), but it doesn't.  The locking in read_descriptors()
is unnecessary.

It seems okay to me.  Please submit a patch.

So this removes the locking making the point about -EINTR in
the first path moot.
