Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/035a1539.failed

When shutting down the NIC, we shutdown async event processing before
freeing all the rings.  If there is a link change event during reset, the
driver may miss it and the link state may be incorrect after the NIC is
re-opened.  Poll the link at the end of __bnxt_open_nic() to get the
correct link status.
