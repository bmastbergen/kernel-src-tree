Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/63d0b4a5.failed

While running perftests, there is a significant utilization of the
random number daemon. This is due to the linux/random.h header being
included in qp.c and verbs.c. However, none of the functions from this
header are being used in these files, so remove the unnecessary header.
