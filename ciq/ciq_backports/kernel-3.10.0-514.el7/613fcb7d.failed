Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Right now, the kernel can only switch between 64-bit and 32-bit
binaries at compile time. This patch adds support for 32-bit
binaries on 64-bit kernels when we support ia32 emulation.

We essentially choose which set of table sizes to use when doing
arithmetic for the bounds table calculations.

This also uses a different approach for calculating the table
indexes than before.  I think the new one makes it much more
clear what is going on, and allows us to share more code between
the 32-bit and 64-bit cases.
