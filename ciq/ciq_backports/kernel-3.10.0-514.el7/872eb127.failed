commit 872eb127e3a6cddcfca1410bb808d9b9bc773dc1
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/872eb127.failed

When userspace does a write, there's no need for the written data to
pollute the CPU cache.  This matches the original XIP code.
