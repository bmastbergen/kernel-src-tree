Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/1fa72e29.failed

Only MSI-X can be used on a VF.  The driver should fail initialization
if it cannot successfully enable MSI-X.
