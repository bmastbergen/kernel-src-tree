Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/fbde1414.failed

Consolidate the parameters passed to arena_is_valid into just nd_btt,
and an info block to increase re-usability.

Similarly, btt_arena_write_layout doesn't need to be passed a uuid, as
it can be obtained from arena->nd_btt.
