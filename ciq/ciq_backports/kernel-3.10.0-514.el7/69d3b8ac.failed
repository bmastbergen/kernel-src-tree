Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/69d3b8ac.failed

Currently traversal and modification of ctrl->namespaces happens completely
unsynchronized, which can be fixed by the addition of a simple mutex.

Note: nvme_dev_ioctl will be handled in the next patch.
