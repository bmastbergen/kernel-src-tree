Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/1b8d2afd.failed

I had relied on the kbuild robot for cross build coverage, however it
only builds alpha_defconfig.  Switch from HPAGE_SIZE to PMD_SIZE, which
is more widely defined.
