Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

In the deboost path, right after the dl_boosted flag has been
reset, we can currently end up replenishing using -deadline
parameters of a !SCHED_DEADLINE entity. This of course causes
a bug, as those parameters are empty.

In the case depicted above it is safe to simply bail out, as
the deboosted task is going to be back to its original scheduling
class anyway.
