Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/83cc54a6.failed

Comment the less obvious portion of the code for setting up memory windows,
and the platform dependency for initializing the h/w with appropriate
resources.
