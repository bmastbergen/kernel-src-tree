Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/1ba93d42.failed

1) Nobody calls pick_dl_task() with negative cpu, it's old RT leftover.

2) If p->nr_cpus_allowed is 1, than the affinity has just been changed
  in set_cpus_allowed_ptr(); we'll pick it just earlier than migration
  thread.
