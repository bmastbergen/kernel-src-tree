Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/45019a18.failed

Also, no need to check for bp->rx_nr_rings as it is always >= 1.  If the
allocation fails, it is not a fatal error and we can still proceed.
