Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ff8e92d5.failed

alloc_disk(0) does not require or use a ->major number,
all devices are allocated with a major of BLOCK_EXT_MAJOR.

So don't allocate btt_major.
