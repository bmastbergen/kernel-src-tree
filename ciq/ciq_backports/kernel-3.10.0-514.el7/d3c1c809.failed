FW has gained new capability where a FW client can asynchronously
notify the host that an event has occurred in its process.
The notification doesn't provide any data and host may need to query
further the FW client in order to get details of the event.
Host can subscribe or unsubscribe to the event notification via
designated HBM commands, and also the notification is carried on
a new HBM command.
This patch adds definitions of asynchronous notification HBM commands.
