Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/979d4c18.failed

posix_acl_xattr_set() already does the check, and it's the only
way to feed in an ACL from userspace.
So the check here is useless, remove it.
