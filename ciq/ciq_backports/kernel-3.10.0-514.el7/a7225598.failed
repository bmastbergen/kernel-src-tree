Commit 4995734e973a "acpi, nfit: fix acpi_check_dsm() vs zero functions
implemented" attempted to fix a QEMU regression by supporting its usage
of a zero-mask as a valid response to a DSM-family probe request.
However, this behavior breaks HP platforms that return a zero-mask by
default causing the probe to misidentify the DSM-family.

Instead, the QEMU regression can be fixed by simply not requiring the DSM
family to be identified.

This effectively reverts commit 4995734e973a, and removes the DSM
requirement from the init path.
