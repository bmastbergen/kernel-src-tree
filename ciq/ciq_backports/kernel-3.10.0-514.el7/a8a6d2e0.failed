Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/a8a6d2e0.failed

Now that all shared mappings are handled by devm_nvdimm_memremap() we no
longer need nfit_spa_map() nor do we need to trigger a callback to the
bus provider at region disable time.
