Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/e413ad7c.failed

Previously the return value of the last acpi_bus_get_device() was
returned. However, since we only report those issues, it should be
cleared to continue as expected.
