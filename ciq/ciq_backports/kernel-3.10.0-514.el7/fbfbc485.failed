Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/fbfbc485.failed

Add a new function bnxt_do_send_msg() to do essentially the same thing
with an additional paramter to silence error response messages.  All
current callers will set silent to false.
