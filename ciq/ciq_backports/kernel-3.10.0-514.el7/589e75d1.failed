Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/589e75d1.failed

This masking prevents access to the end of the device via dax_do_io(),
and is unnecessary as arch_add_memory() would have rejected an unaligned
allocation.
