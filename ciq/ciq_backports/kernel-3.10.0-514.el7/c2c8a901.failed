Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/c2c8a901.failed

This only blows up the size of the test structure for no gain
in test coverage. Reduces size of test_obj from 24 to 16 bytes.
