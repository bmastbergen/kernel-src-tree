Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ba41d46f.failed

If we fail to update the PHY, we should print a warning and continue.
The current code to exit is buggy as it has not freed up the NIC
resources yet.
