PARAVIRT_ADJUST_EXCEPTION_FRAME generates this code (using nmi as an
example, trimmed for readability):

    ff 15 00 00 00 00       callq  *0x0(%rip)        # 2796 <nmi+0x6>
              2792: R_X86_64_PC32     pv_irq_ops+0x2c

That's a call through a function pointer to regular C function that
does nothing on native boots, but that function isn't protected
against kprobes, isn't marked notrace, and is certainly not
guaranteed to preserve any registers if the compiler is feeling
perverse.  This is bad news for a CLBR_NONE operation.

Of course, if everything works correctly, once paravirt ops are
patched, it gets nopped out, but what if we hit this code before
paravirt ops are patched in?  This can potentially cause breakage
that is very difficult to debug.

A more subtle failure is possible here, too: if _paravirt_nop uses
the stack at all (even just to push RBP), it will overwrite the "NMI
executing" variable if it's called in the NMI prologue.

The Xen case, perhaps surprisingly, is fine, because it's already
written in asm.

Fix all of the cases that default to paravirt_nop (including
adjust_exception_frame) with a big hammer: replace paravirt_nop with
an asm function that is just a ret instruction.

The Xen case may have other problems, so document them.

This is part of a fix for some random crashes that Sasha saw.
