Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3c02d1bb.failed

To report flow control tx/rx settings accurately regardless of autoneg
setting, we should use link_info->req_flow_ctrl.  Before this patch,
the reported settings were only correct when autoneg was on.
