Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/d068c350.failed

The bus always starts at 0.  Due to alignment and down-casting, this
happened to work before, but looked alarmingly incorrect in kernel logs.
