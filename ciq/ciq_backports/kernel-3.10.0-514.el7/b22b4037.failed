Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/b22b4037.failed

The operator used to double the master context response delay
is incorrect and does not result in delay doubling.

To fix, use a left shift instead of the XOR operator.
