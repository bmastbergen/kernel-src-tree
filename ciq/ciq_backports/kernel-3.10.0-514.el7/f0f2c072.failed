Add support in the NFIT BLK I/O path for the "latch" flag
defined in the "Get Block NVDIMM Flags" _DSM function:

http://pmem.io/documents/NVDIMM_DSM_Interface_Example.pdf

This flag requires the driver to read back the command register after it
is written in the block I/O path.  This ensures that the hardware has
fully processed the new command and moved the aperture appropriately.
