Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/be58a0da.failed

During remove_one, the driver should issue hwrm_func_drv_unrgtr
command to inform firmware that this function has been unloaded.
This is to let firmware keep track of driver present/absent state
when driver is gracefully unloaded. A keep alive timer is needed
later to keep track of driver state during abnormal shutdown.
