Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3abb33ac.failed

The upcoming TID caching feature requires different data
structures and, by extension, different initialization for each
of the MPI processes.

The two new functions (currently unused) perform the required
initialization and freeing of required resources and structures.
