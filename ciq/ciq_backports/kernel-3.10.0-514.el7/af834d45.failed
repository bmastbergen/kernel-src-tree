commit af834d457d9ed69e14836b63d0da198fdd2ec706
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/af834d45.failed

Drop use of access_ok() since we are already using copy_{to|from}_user()
which do their own access_ok().
