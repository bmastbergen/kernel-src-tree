Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/95e435af.failed

A maximum table size of 64k entries is insufficient for the multiple
threads test even in default configuration (10 threads * 50000 objects =
500000 objects in total). Since we know how many objects will be
inserted, calculate the max size unless overridden by parameter.

Note that specifying the exact number of objects upon table init won't
suffice as that value is being rounded down to the next power of two -
anticipate this by rounding up to the next power of two in beforehand.
