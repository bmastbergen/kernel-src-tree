Following an adapter reset, the AFU RRQ that resides in host memory
holds stale data. This can lead to a condition where the RRQ interrupt
handler tries to process stale entries and/or endlessly loops due to an
out of sync generation bit.

To fix, the AFU RRQ in host memory needs to be cleared after each reset.
