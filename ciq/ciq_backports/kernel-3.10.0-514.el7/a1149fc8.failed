Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/a1149fc8.failed

When we allocate a bounds table, we call mmap(), then add a
"valid" bit to the value before storing it in to the bounds
directory.

If we fail along the way, we go and mask that valid bit
_back_ out.  That seems a little silly, and this makes it
much more clear when we have a plain address versus an
actual table _entry_.
