Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/4f0909ee.failed

New, related connections are marked as such as part of ovs_ct_lookup(),
but they are not marked as "new" if the commit flag is used. Make this
consistent by setting the "new" flag whenever !nf_ct_is_confirmed(ct).
