Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/01ed67dc.failed

Since we notify disconnecting based on the usb device is existed
(port_dev->child, the child device at roothub is not NULL), we
need to notify connect after device has been registered.

This fixes a bug that do fast plug in/out test, and the notify_disconnect
is not called due to roothub child is NULL and the enumeration has failed.
