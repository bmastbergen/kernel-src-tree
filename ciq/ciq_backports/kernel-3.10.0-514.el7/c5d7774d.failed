Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/c5d7774d.failed

Fix the sp event bits to be bit positions instead of bit values since
the bit helper functions are expecting the former.
