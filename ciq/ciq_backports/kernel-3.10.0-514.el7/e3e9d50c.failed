Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/e3e9d50c.failed

The tag set queue depth needs to be one less than the h/w queue depth
so we don't wrap the circular buffer. This conforms to the specification
defined "Full Queue" condition.
