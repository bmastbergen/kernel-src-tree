Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/1f9788f3.failed

We try to access sta before we check for IS_ERR_OR_NULL(), so we may
end up accessing a NULL pointer.  To prevent that, move the conversion
from sta to mvm_sta below the check.
