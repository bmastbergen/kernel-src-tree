Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/d804621d.failed

The workq can process work in parallel with a remove event, leading
to a condition where the workq handler can access freed memory.

To remedy, the workq should be terminated prior to freeing memory. Move
the termination call earlier in remove and use cancel_work_sync() instead
of flush_work() as there is not a need to process any scheduled work when
shutting down.
