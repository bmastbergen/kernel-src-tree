pmem_rw_page() needs to call wmb_pmem() on writes to make sure that the
newly written data is durable.  This flow was added to pmem_rw_bytes()
and pmem_make_request() with this commit:

commit 61031952f4c8 ("arch, x86: pmem api for ensuring durability of
	persistent memory updates")

...the pmem_rw_page() path was missed.
