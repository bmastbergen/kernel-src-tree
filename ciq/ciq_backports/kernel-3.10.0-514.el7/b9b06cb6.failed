Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/b9b06cb6.failed

The iowait_sdma_drained() callback lacked locking to
protect the qp s_flags field.

This causes the s_flags to be out of sync
on multiple CPUs, potentially corrupting the s_flags.
