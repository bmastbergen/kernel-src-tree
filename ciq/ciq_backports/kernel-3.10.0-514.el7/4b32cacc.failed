Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/4b32cacc.failed

The supported bits and advertising bits in ethtool have the same
definitions.  The same is true for the firmware bits.  So use the
common function to handle the conversion for both supported and
advertising bits.

v2: Don't use parentheses on function return.
