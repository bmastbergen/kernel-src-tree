Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/60fcdac8.failed

We don't free buffer on several code paths in hv_pci_onchannelcallback(),
put kfree() to the end of the function to fix the issue.  Direct { kfree();
return; } can now be replaced with a simple 'break';
