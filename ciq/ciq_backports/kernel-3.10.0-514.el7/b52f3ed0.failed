Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/b52f3ed0.failed

A NULL token is meaningless and can only lead to unintended problems.
Error on registration with a NULL token, ignore de-registrations with
a NULL token.
