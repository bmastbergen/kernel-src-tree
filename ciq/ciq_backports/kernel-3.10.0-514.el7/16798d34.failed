Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/16798d34.failed

A bug was introduced earlier in the development cycle when cleaning
up logic statements. Instead of skipping bits that are not set, set
bits are skipped, causing async interrupts to not be handled correctly.

To fix, simply add back in the proper evaluation for an unset bit.
