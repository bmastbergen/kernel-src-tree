Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/91cdca4f.failed

We were having a race between the completion of the client open and
calls to the client ops so don't call a client op unless we are sure the
client is open.

Testing Hints: Load IWARP driver and make sure it works as expected.
