Testing the dax-device autodetect support revealed a probe failure with
the following result:

    dax0.1: bad offset: 0x8200000 dax disabled

The original pfn-device implementation inferred the alignment from
ilog2(offset), now that the alignment is explicit the is_power_of_2()
needs replacing with a real sanity check against the recorded alignment.
Otherwise the alignment check is useless in the implicit case and only
the minimum size of the offset matters.

This self-consistency check is further validated by the probe path that
will re-check that the offset is large enough to contain all the
metadata required to enable the device.
