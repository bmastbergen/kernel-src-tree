Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/cf89813a.failed

The while loop was spinning. Fix by removing a semicolon.

The issue was pointed out by gcc-6's -Wmisleading-indentation.
