commit 8378af17a4021f01b3bed20c1bd19c3921c1f5ac
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/8378af17.failed

I/O errors events have the potential to be a high frequency and a log
message for each event can swamp the system.  This message is also
redundant with upper layer error reporting.
