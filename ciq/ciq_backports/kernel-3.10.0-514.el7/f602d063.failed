Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/f602d063.failed

There was a prototype for it added to kernel/sched/sched.h
at the same time the extern was added, so the extern in
the C file was never really ever needed.

See commit 332ac17ef5bfcff4766dfdfd3b4cdf10b8f8f155
("sched/deadline: Add bandwidth management for SCHED_DEADLINE
tasks") for details.
