Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/259aada4.failed

It seems we have same message for different return values in get_sem() and
baytrail_i2c_acquire(). I suspect this is just a typo, so this patch fixes it.
