commit 298f2bc5db3851cf2e839a0025425256ef852139
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/298f2bc5.failed

We can derive the common namespace from other information.  We also do
not need to cache it because all the usages are in slow paths.
