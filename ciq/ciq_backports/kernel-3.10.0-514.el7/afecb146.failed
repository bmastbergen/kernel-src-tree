The Optiplex 9020m with Haswell-DT processor needs a quirk for the
headset jack at the front of the machine to be able to use microphones.

A quirk for this model was originally added in 3127899, but c77900e
removed it in favour of a more generic version.

Unfortunately, pin configurations can changed based on firmware/BIOS
versions, and the generic version doesn't have any effect on newer
versions of the machine/firmware anymore.
