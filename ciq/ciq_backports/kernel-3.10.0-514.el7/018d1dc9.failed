Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/018d1dc9.failed

Borrowing the TMF waitq's spinlock causes a stall condition when
waiting for the TMF to complete. To remedy, introduce our own spin
lock to serialize TMF and use the appropriate wait services.

Also add a timeout while waiting for a TMF completion. When a TMF
times out, report back a failure such that a bigger hammer reset
can occur.
