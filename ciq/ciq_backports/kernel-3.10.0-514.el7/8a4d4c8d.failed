commit 8a4d4c8dde7a4119bce3fd8287dca193ff6356da
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/8a4d4c8d.failed

This hardware counter is misleading as it counts dropped packets that
don't match the hardware filters for unicast/broadcast/multicast.  We
will still report this counter in ethtool -S for diagnostics purposes.
