commit 439e85c1e89bd1ed8c99f8b46f87f495a675d95e
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/439e85c1.failed

Limbo is not an accurate representation of this state and is
also not consistent with the terminology that other drivers
use to represent this concept. Rename the state and and its
associated waitq to 'reset'.
