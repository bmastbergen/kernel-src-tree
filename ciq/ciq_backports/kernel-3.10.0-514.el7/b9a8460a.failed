Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/b9a8460a.failed

Set the is_push flag in the software BD before the tx data is pushed to
the chip.  It is possible to get the tx interrupt as soon as the tx data
is pushed.  The tx handler will not handle the event properly if the
is_push flag is not set and it will crash.
