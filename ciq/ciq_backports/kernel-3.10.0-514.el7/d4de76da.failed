Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/d4de76da.failed

Preperatory patch for FRMR support. From connection info,
we can retrieve cm_id which contains qp handled needed for
work request posting.

We also need to drop the RDS connection on QP error states
where connection handle becomes useful.
