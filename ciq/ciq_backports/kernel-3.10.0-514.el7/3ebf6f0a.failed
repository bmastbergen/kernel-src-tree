Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3ebf6f0a.failed

For everything to fit, we remove the PHY microcode version and replace it
with the firmware package version in the fw_version string.
