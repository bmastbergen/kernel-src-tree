The commit efb6de9b4ba0092b2c55f6a52d16294a8a698edd "netfilter: bridge:
forward IPv6 fragmented packets" introduced a new function
br_validate_ipv6 which take a reference on the inet6 device. Although,
the reference is not released at the end.

This will result to the impossibility to destroy any netdevice using
ipv6 and bridge.

It's possible to directly retrieve the inet6 device without taking a
reference as all netfilter hooks are protected by rcu_read_lock via
nf_hook_slow.

Spotted while trying to destroy a Xen guest on the upstream Linux:
"unregister_netdevice: waiting for vif1.0 to become free. Usage count = 1"
