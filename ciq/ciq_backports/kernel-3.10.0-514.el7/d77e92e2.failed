As part of the v4.3 merge window the DAX code was updated by Matthew and
Kirill to handle PMD pages.  Also as part of the v4.3 merge window we
updated the DAX code to do proper PMEM flushing (commit 2765cfbb342c:
"dax: update I/O path to do proper PMEM flushing").

The additional code added by the DAX PMD patches also needs to be
updated to properly use the PMEM API.  This ensures that after a PMD
fault is handled the zeros written to the newly allocated pages are
durable on the DIMMs.

linux/dax.h is included to get rid of a bunch of sparse warnings.
