Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/028de140.failed

The reset logic calls bnxt_close_nic() and bnxt_open_nic() under rtnl_lock
from bnxt_sp_task.  BNXT_STATE_IN_SP_TASK must be cleared before calling
bnxt_close_nic() to avoid deadlock.

v2: Fixed white space error.  Thanks Dave.
