Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ac71b46e.failed

For the input parameter count, it's better to use the size
of destination buffer size, as nla_memcpy would take into
account the length of the source netlink attribute when
a data is copied from an attribute.
