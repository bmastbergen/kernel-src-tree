Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/67a95e20.failed

The code determines if the next ring entry is valid before proceeding
further to read the rest of the entry.  The CPU can re-order and read
the rest of the entry first, possibly reading a stale entry, if DMA
of a new entry happens right after reading it.  This issue can be
readily seen on a ppc64 system, causing it to crash.
