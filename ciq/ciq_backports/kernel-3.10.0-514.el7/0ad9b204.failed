Readers/Writers lock for SW timecounter was acquired without disabling
interrupts on local CPU.

The problematic scenario:
* HW timestamping is enabled
* Timestamp overflow periodic service task is running on local CPU and
  holding write_lock for SW timecounter
* Completion arrives, triggers interrupt for local CPU.
  Interrupt routine calls napi_schedule(), which triggers rx/tx
  skb process.
  An attempt to read SW timecounter using read_lock is done, which is
  already locked by a writer on the same CPU and cause soft lockup.

Add irqsave/irqrestore for when using the readers/writers lock for
writing.
