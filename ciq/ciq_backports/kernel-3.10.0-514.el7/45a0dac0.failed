Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/45a0dac0.failed

We want to use the alignment as the allocation and mapping unit.
Previously this information was only useful for establishing the data
offset, but now it is important to remember the granularity for the
later use.
