Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/659c805c.failed

Define all the supported chip numbers and chip categories.  Store the
chip_num returned by firmware.  If the call to get the version and chip
number fails, we should abort.
