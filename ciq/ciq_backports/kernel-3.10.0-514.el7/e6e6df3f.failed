Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

A 'login timed out' asynchronous error interrupt is generated if no
response is seen to a FLOGI within 2 seconds.  If the time out error
is not escalated to a LINK_RESET the port will not be available for
use. This fix provides the required escalation.
