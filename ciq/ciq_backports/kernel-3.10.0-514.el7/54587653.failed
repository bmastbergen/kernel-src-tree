Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/54587653.failed

Currently, to get from a bounds directory entry to the virtual
address of a bounds table, we simply mask off a few low bits.
However, the set of bits we mask off is different for 32-bit and
64-bit binaries.

This breaks the operation out in to a helper function and also
adds a temporary variable to store the result until we are
sure we are returning one.
