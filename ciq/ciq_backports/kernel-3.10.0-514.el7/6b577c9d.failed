Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

When support for _FIT was added, the code presumed that the data
returned by the _FIT method is identical to the NFIT table, which
starts with an acpi_table_header.  However, the _FIT is defined
to return a data in the format of a series of NFIT type structure
entries and as a method, has an acpi_object header rather tahn
an acpi_table_header.

To address the differences, explicitly save the acpi_table_header
from the NFIT, since it is accessible through /sys, and change
the nfit pointer in the acpi_desc structure to point to the
table entries rather than the headers.
