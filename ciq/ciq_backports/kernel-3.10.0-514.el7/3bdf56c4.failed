Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3bdf56c4.failed

Gather periodic port statistics if the device is PF and link is up.  This
is triggered in bnxt_timer() every one second to request firmware to DMA
the counters.
