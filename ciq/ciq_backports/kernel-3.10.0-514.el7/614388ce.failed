Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/614388ce.failed

The profile ID in the completion record needs to be ANDed with the
profile ID mask of 0x1f.  This bug was causing the SKB hash type
and the gso_type to be wrong in some cases.
