Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/85599218.failed

Having a date for the driver requires it to be updated quite
often. Removing the date which is not necessary. Also made
use of the existing symbol to print the driver name.
