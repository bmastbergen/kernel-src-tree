Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/309369c9.failed

Newer chips require different logic to handle GRO packets.  So refactor
the code so that we can call different functions depending on the chip.
