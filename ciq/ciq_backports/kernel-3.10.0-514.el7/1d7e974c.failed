Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/1d7e974c.failed

There is no need to do balance during fork since SCHED_DEADLINE
tasks can't fork. This patch avoid the SD_BALANCE_FORK check.
