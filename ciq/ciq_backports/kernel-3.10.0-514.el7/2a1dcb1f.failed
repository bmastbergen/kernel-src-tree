Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/2a1dcb1f.failed

There are two different events being traced here.  They are
doing similar things so share a trace "EVENT_CLASS" and are
presented together.

1. Trace when MPX is zapping pages "mpx_unmap_zap":

	When MPX can not free an entire bounds table, it will
	instead try to zap unused parts of a bounds table to free
	the backing memory.  This decreases RSS (resident set
	size) without decreasing the virtual space allocated
	for bounds tables.

2. Trace attempts to find bounds tables "mpx_unmap_search":

	This event traces any time we go looking to unmap a
	bounds table for a given virtual address range.  This is
	useful to ensure that the kernel actually "tried" to free
	a bounds table versus times it succeeded in finding one.

	It might try and fail if it realized that a table was
	shared with an adjacent VMA which is not being unmapped.
