__arch_wb_cache_pmem() was already an internal implementation detail of
the x86 PMEM API, but this functionality needs to be exported as part of
the general PMEM API to handle the fsync/msync case for DAX mmaps.

One thing worth noting is that we really do want this to be part of the
PMEM API as opposed to a stand-alone function like clflush_cache_range()
because of ordering restrictions.  By having wb_cache_pmem() as part of
the PMEM API we can leave it unordered, call it multiple times to write
back large amounts of memory, and then order the multiple calls with a
single wmb_pmem().
