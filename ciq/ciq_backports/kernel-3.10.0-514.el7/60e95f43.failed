Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/60e95f43.failed

The _STA only applies to the root device, not the individual NVDIMMS,
so don't check here. NVDIMM device state flags are checked elsewhere.
