Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/0b10029d.failed

This was accidently broken for harvest cards when the
code was refactored for Polaris support.

v2: multiply by shader engines.  Noticed by Nicolai.
