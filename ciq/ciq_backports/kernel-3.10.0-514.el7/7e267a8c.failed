Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/7e267a8c.failed

Given that nvdimm_flush() has higher overhead than wmb_pmem() (pointer
chasing through nd_region), and that we otherwise assume a platform has
ADR capability when flush hints are not present, move nvdimm_flush() to
REQ_FLUSH context.

Note that we still arrange for nvdimm_flush() to be called even in the
ADR case. We need at least once wmb() fence to push buffered writes in
the cpu out to the ADR protected domain.
