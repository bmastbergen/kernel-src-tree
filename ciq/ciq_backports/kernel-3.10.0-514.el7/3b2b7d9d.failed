commit 3b2b7d9db74adb95aa0bd029298a741333eb847e
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3b2b7d9d.failed

Each bnxt_napi structure may no longer be having both an rx ring and
a tx ring.  Check for a valid ring before using it.
