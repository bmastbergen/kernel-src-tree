We don't need to shutdown a controller for a reset. A controller in a
shutdown state may take longer to become ready than one that was simply
disabled. This patch has the driver shut down a controller only if the
device is about to be powered off or being removed. When taking the
controller down for a reset reason, the controller will be disabled
instead.

Function names have been updated in this patch to reflect their changed
semantics.
