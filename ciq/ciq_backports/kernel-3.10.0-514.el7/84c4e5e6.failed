Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/84c4e5e6.failed

Jan Kara pointed out I should be more explicit here about the perils of
racing against truncate.  The comment is mostly the same as for the PTE
case.
