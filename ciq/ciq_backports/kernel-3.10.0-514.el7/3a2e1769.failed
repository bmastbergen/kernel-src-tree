nfs: offer native ioctls even if CONFIG_COMPAT is set

commit 3a2e176905b1a8d1b51cbfda719058f5ce893efd
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3a2e1769.failed

Without this for example 64-bit binaries on typical amd64 distributions
would not be able to use ioctls on NFS.  For now this only affects clones.
Additionally ->compat_ioctl is defined even for non-compat builds, so
get rid of the pointless ifdef.
