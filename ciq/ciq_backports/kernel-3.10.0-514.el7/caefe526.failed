commit caefe526d7b5af11d9b5977b2862eb144fa45537
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/caefe526.failed

This allows multiple independent bits to be set for various states.
Subsequent patches to implement tx timeout reset will require this.
