Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/068c9ec6.failed

The driver can support either all combined or all rx/tx rings.  The
default is combined, but the user can now select rx/tx rings.
