Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/4922d491.failed

Version 1.01.

This firmware is made for Kabylake platform so it doesn't
need the stepping workaround that we had before.

v2: Rebased on top of latest nightly with min version
    required change.
v3: With right CSR_VERSION (Patrik).
