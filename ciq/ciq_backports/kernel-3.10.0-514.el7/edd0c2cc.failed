Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/edd0c2cc.failed

Remove the unnecessary "if" statement before the "for" statement:

if (x) {
        for (i = 0; i < x; i++)
...
}

Also, change the ring free function to return void as it only returns 0.
