Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/0636e9ab.failed

The original code used a LRU list to evict nodes which were least
recently used.  For correctness the evict code was moved under the
handler->lock, now add back the LRU list.
