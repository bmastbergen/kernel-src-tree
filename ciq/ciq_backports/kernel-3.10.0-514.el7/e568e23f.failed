Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/e568e23f.failed

Using sizeof(bool) is considered poor form for various reasons and
sparse warns us of that. Correct by changing type from bool to u8.
