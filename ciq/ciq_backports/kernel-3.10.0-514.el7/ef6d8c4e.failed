Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ef6d8c4e.failed

The changes are to aid in coorelating trace information
with QPs between the trace and qp_stats information

Such changes include adds a space after QP and clarifying that the second
QP is actually the remote QP.
