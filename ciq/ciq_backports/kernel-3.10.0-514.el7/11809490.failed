Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/11809490.failed

In order to use offset 0x4014 for reading CAG interrupt status,
the actual CAG register must be mapped to GRC bar0 window #4.
Otherwise, the driver is reading garbage. This patch corrects
this issue.
