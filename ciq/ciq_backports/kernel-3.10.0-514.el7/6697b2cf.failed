ACPI 6.1 clarified that multi-interface dimms require multiple control
region entries (DCRs) per dimm.  Previously we were assuming that a
control region is only present when block-data-windows are present.
This implementation was done with an eye to be compatibility with the
looser ACPI 6.0 interpretation of this table.

1/ When coalescing the memory device (MEMDEV) tables for a single dimm,
coalesce on device_handle rather than control region index.

2/ Whenever we disocver a control region with non-zero block windows
re-scan for block-data-window (BDW) entries.

We may need to revisit this if a DIMM ever implements a format interface
outside of blk or pmem, but that is not on the foreseeable horizon.
