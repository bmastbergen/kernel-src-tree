In preparation for providing an alternative (to block device) access
mechanism to persistent memory, convert pmem_rw_bytes() to
nsio_rw_bytes().  This allows ->rw_bytes() functionality without
requiring a 'struct pmem_device' to be instantiated.

In other words, when ->rw_bytes() is in use i/o is driven through
'struct nd_namespace_io', otherwise it is driven through 'struct
pmem_device' and the block layer.  This consolidates the disjoint calls
to devm_exit_badblocks() and devm_memunmap() into a common
devm_nsio_disable() and cleans up the init path to use a unified
pmem_attach_disk() implementation.
