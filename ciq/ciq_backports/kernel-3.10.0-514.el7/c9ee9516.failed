Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/c9ee9516.failed

Make use of the new AUTONEG_PAUSE bit in the new interface to better
control autoneg flow control settings, independent of RX and TX
advertisement settings.
