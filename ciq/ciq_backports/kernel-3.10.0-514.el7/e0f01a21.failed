Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/e0f01a21.failed

Implement the following suggestions and add two new attributes
to allow for debugging the port LUN table.

 - use scnprintf() instead of snprintf()
 - use DEVICE_ATTR_RO and DEVICE_ATTR_RW
