With the current value of cmd_per_lun at 16, the throughput
over a single adapter is limited to around 150kIOPS.

Increase the value of cmd_per_lun to 256 to improve
throughput. With this change a single adapter is able to
attain close to the maximum throughput (380kIOPS).
Also change the number of RRQ entries that can be queued.
