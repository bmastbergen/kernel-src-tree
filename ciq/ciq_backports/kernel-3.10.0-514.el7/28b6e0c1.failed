Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/28b6e0c1.failed

There is no need to help connections that are not confirmed, so we can
delay helping new connections to the time when they are confirmed.
This change is needed for NAT support, and having this as a separate
patch will make the following NAT patch a bit easier to review.
