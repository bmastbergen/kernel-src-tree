Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/e3654eca.failed

Clarify the distinction between "commands", the ioctls userspace calls
to request the kernel take some action on a given dimm device, and
"_DSMs", the actual function numbers used in the firmware interface to
the DIMM.  _DSMs are ACPI specific whereas commands are Linux kernel
generic.

This is in preparation for breaking the 1:1 implicit relationship
between the kernel ioctl number space and the firmware specific function
numbers.
