Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/aef25338.failed

The return value from an 'ndctl_fn' reports the command execution
status, i.e. was the command properly formatted and was it successfully
submitted to the bus provider.  The new 'cmd_rc' parameter allows the bus
provider to communicate command specific results, translated into
common error codes.

Convert the ARS commands to this scheme to:

1/ Consolidate status reporting

2/ Prepare for for expanding ars unit test cases

3/ Make the implementation more generic
