Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/30f471fd.failed

dax_pfn_mkwrite() previously wasn't checking the return value of the
call to dax_radix_entry(), which was a mistake.

Instead, capture this return value and return the appropriate VM_FAULT_
value.
