Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/6a19cc8c.failed

A recent change added MGMT_ADV_FLAG_DISCOV to the flags returned by
get_adv_instance_flags(), however failed to take into account limited
discoverable mode. This patch fixes the issue by setting the correct
discoverability flag in the AD data.
