Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/b765a16a.failed

when a LS or FS device doesn't connect though a HS hub,
the @bPkts field of its periodic endpoint context should
be set to 1.
