Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/5a267953.failed

Use kcalloc rather than kzalloc when multiplied by size to prevent
integer overflows. This change also makes code nicer to read.
