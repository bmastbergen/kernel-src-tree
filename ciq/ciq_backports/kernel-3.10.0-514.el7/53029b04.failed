Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/53029b04.failed

We don't want to allow new references to open on a device that is
removed. This ties the lifetime of these handles to the physical device's
presence rather than to the open reference count.
