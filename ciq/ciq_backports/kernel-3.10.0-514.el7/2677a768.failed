commit 2677a7680e773195a4fdabd163d756cac1b9abd7
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/2677a768.failed

During an unexpected shutdown, references to tid_rb_node were NULL'ed out
without properly being released.

Fix this by calling clear_tid_node in the mmu notifier remove callback
rather than after these callbacks are called.
