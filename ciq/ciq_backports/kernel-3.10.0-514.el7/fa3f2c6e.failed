Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/fa3f2c6e.failed

The trace following the failure of alloc_mem() incorrectly identifies
which function failed. This can lead to misdiagnosing a failure.

Fix the string to correctly indicate that alloc_mem() failed.
