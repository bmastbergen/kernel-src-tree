Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Factor out a helper to set all the device specific queue limits and apply
them to the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues.  Without this the
command size on the admin queue is arbitrarily low, and the missing
other limitations are just minefields waiting for victims.
