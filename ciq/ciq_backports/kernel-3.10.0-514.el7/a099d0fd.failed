commit a099d0fdb34f00cee346703036a0a90d267e77d7
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/a099d0fd.failed

Use memset() to null out the btrfs_delayed_ref_root of
btrfs_transaction instead of setting all the members to 0 by hand.
