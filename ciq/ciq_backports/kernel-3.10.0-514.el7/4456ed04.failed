Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Many virtual and not quite virtual devices allow any speed to be set
through ethtool. In particular, this applies to the virtio-net devices.
Document this fact to make sure people don't assume the enum lists all
possible values.  Reserve values greater than INT_MAX for future
extension and to avoid conflict with SPEED_UNKNOWN.
