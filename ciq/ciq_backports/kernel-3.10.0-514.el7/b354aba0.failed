Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/b354aba0.failed

ida instances allocate some internal memory for ->free_bitmap in
addition to the base 'struct ida'.  Use ida_destroy() to release that
memory at module_exit().
