When btt devices were re-worked to be child devices of regions this
routine was overlooked.  It mistakenly attempts to_nd_namespace_pmem()
or to_nd_namespace_blk() conversions on btt and pfn devices.  By luck to
date we have happened to be hitting valid memory leading to a uuid
miscompare, but a recent change to struct nd_namespace_common causes:

 BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000001
