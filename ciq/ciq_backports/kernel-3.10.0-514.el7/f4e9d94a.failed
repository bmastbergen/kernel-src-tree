Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/f4e9d94a.failed

Use nr_cpus_allowed to bail from select_task_rq() when only one cpu
can be used, and saves some cycles for pinned tasks.
