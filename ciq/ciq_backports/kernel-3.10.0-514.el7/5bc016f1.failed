Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/5bc016f1.failed

Complete the set of dependent features that need disabling at
once: XSAVEC, AVX-512 and all currently known to the kernel
extensions to it, as well as MPX need to be disabled too.
