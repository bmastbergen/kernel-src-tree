Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/f7ec8368.failed

The implementation for the new "DIMM Flags" DSM relies on the -ENOTTY
return code to indicate that the flags are unimplimented and to fall
back to a safe default.  As is the -ENXIO error code erroneoously
indicates to fail enabling a BLK region.
