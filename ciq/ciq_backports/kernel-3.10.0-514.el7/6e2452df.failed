Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/6e2452df.failed

If firmware doesn't implement any of the ARS commands, take that to
mean that ARS is unsupported, and continue to initialize regions without
bad block lists. We cannot make the assumption that ARS commands will be
unconditionally supported on all NVDIMMs.
