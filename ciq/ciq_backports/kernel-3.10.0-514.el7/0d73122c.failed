Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/0d73122c.failed

When running with lock instrumentation (e.g. lockdep), some of the
instrumentation can become disabled at probe time for a cxlflash
adapter. This is due to a missing lock registration for the tmf_slock.

The fix is to call spin_lock_init() for the tmf_slock during probe.
