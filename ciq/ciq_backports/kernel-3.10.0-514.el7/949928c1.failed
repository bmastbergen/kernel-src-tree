Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/949928c1.failed

This notifies blk-mq when the tag set contains a different number of
queues prior to freeing unused ones that the request queue points to.
