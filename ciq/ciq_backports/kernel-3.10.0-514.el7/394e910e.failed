Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/394e910e.failed

Only a successful nf_conntrack_in() call can effect a connection state
change, so it suffices to update the key only after the
nf_conntrack_in() returns.

This change is needed for the later NAT patches.
