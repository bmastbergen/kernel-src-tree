Device dependent flags are needed to support functions that are specific
to a particular device.

One such case is - some CXL Flash cards need to be notified of device
shutdown. For other CXL devices, this feature does not prove to be
useful yet. Such distinct features need to be identified in the driver
to bypass or invoke specific functionality.

In this patch, a member 'flags' has been added to device dependent
values. These flags will be used and expanded in the future to support
various device specific functions.
