Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/b664f008.failed

Call bnxt_cfg_rx_mode() in bnxt_init_chip() to setup uc_list and
mc_list mac address filters.  Before the patch, uc_list is not
setup again after chip reset (such as ethtool ring size change)
and macvlans don't work any more after that.

Modify bnxt_cfg_rx_mode() to return error codes appropriately so
that the init chip sequence can detect any failures.
