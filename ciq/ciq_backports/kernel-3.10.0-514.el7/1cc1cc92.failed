Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/1cc1cc92.failed

Fields like HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT are outside of the physical collection,
but within the application collection and report ID.  Make sure to catch
those fields that are not part of the mt_report_id and return 0 so they
can be processed with the pen.  Otherwise, the wrong HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT
will be applied to cc_index and result in dereferencing a null pointer in
mt_touch_report.
