The MPX code needs to clear out bounds tables for memory which
is no longer in use.  We do this when a userspace mapping is
torn down (unmapped).

There are two modes:

  1. An entire bounds table becomes unused, and can be freed
     and its pointer removed from the bounds directory.  This
     happens either when a large mapping is torn down, or when
     a small mapping is torn down and it is the last mapping
     "covered" by a bounds table.

  2. Only part of a bounds table becomes unused, in which case
     we free the backing memory as if MADV_DONTNEED was called.

The old code was a spaghetti mess of "edge" bounds tables
where the edges were handled specially, even if we were
unmapping an entire one.  Non-edge bounds tables are always
fully unmapped, but share a different code path from the edge
ones.  The old code had a bug where it was unmapping too much
memory.  I worked on fixing it for two days and gave up.

I didn't write the original code.  I didn't particularly like
it, but it worked, so I left it.  After my debug session, I
realized it was undebuggagle *and* buggy, so out it went.

I also wrote a new unmapping test program which uncovers bugs
pretty nicely.
