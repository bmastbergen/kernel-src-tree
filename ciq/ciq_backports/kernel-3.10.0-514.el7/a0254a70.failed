Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/a0254a70.failed

Somehow the wrong fc_setup function was used for x550em_a, so
correct that. Also set setup_link to NULL as its value is
determined later, just like it is with X550EM_x.
