Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/f15fbf8d.failed

There are several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the
driver. Additionally there are a handful of places where there
are extra lines and unnecessary variables/statements. These are
a nuisance and pollute the driver.

Fix spelling and grammar issues. Update some comments for clarity and
consistency. Remove extra lines and a few unneeded variables/statements.
