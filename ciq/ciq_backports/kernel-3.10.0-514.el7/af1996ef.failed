ACPI 6 defines persistent memory (PMEM) ranges in multiple
firmware interfaces, e820, EFI, and ACPI NFIT table.  This EFI
change, however, leads to hit a bug in the grub bootloader, which
treats EFI_PERSISTENT_MEMORY type as regular memory and corrupts
stored user data [1].

Therefore, BIOS may set generic reserved type in e820 and EFI to
cover PMEM ranges.  The kernel can initialize PMEM ranges from
ACPI NFIT table alone.

This scheme causes a problem in the iomem table, though.  On x86,
for instance, e820_reserve_resources() initializes top-level entries
(iomem_resource.child) from the e820 table at early boot-time.
This creates "reserved" entry for a PMEM range, which does not allow
region_intersects() to check with PMEM type.

Change acpi_nfit_register_region() to call acpi_nfit_insert_resource(),
which calls insert_resource() to insert a PMEM entry from NFIT when
the iomem table does not have a PMEM entry already.  That is, when
a PMEM range is marked as reserved type in e820, it inserts
"Persistent Memory" entry, which results as follows.

 + "Persistent Memory"
    + "reserved"

This allows the EINJ driver, which calls region_intersects() to check
PMEM ranges, to work continuously even if BIOS sets reserved type
(or sets nothing) to PMEM ranges in e820 and EFI.
