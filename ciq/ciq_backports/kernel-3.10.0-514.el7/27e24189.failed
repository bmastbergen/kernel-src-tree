Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/27e24189.failed

If hardware completes single segment rx frames, don't bother setting
up all the GRO related fields.  Pass the SKB up as a normal frame.
