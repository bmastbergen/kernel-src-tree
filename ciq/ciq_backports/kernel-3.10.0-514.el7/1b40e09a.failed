A blk label set describes a namespace comprised of one or more
discontiguous dpa ranges on a single dimm.  They may alias with one or
more pmem interleave sets that include the given dimm.

This is the runtime/volatile configuration infrastructure for sysfs
manipulation of 'alt_name', 'uuid', 'size', and 'sector_size'.  A later
patch will make these settings persistent by writing back the label(s).

Unlike pmem namespaces, multiple blk namespaces can be created per
region.  Once a blk namespace has been created a new seed device
(unconfigured child of a parent blk region) is instantiated.  As long as
a region has 'available_size' != 0 new child namespaces may be created.
