Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Currently we use printk message to notify the throttle event. But this
can flood the console if the cpu is throttled frequently. So replace the
printk with the tracepoint to notify the throttle event. And also events
like throttle below nominal frequency and OCC_RESET are reduced to
pr_warn/pr_warn_once as pointed by MFG to not mark them as critical
messages. This patch adds 'throttle_reason' to struct chip to store the
throttle reason.
