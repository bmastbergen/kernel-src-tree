Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/92268c32.failed

1. Use local variable pf for repeated access to this pointer.

2.  The 2nd argument num_vfs was unnecessarily declared as pointer to int.
This function doesn't change num_vfs so change the argument to int.
