Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/6ef6f940.failed

The host reset handler is called with I/O already blocked, thus
there is no need to explicitly block and unblock I/O in the handler.
