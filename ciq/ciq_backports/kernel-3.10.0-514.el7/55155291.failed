Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/55155291.failed

When alloc_disk(0) or alloc_disk-node(0, XX) is used, the ->major
number is completely ignored:  all devices are allocated with a
major of BLOCK_EXT_MAJOR.

So there is no point allocating pmem_major.
