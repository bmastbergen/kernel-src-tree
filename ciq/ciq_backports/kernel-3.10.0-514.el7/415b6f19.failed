Newly added code in the bnxt driver uses a couple of variables that
are never initialized when CONFIG_BNXT_SRIOV is not set, and gcc
correctly warns about that:

In file included from include/linux/list.h:8:0,
                 from include/linux/module.h:9,
                 from drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnxt/bnxt.c:10:
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnxt/bnxt.c: In function 'bnxt_get_max_rings':
include/linux/kernel.h:794:26: warning: 'cp' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
include/linux/kernel.h:794:26: warning: 'tx' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnxt/bnxt.c:5730:11: warning: 'rx' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnxt/bnxt.c:5736:6: note: 'rx' was declared here

This changes the condition so that we fall back to using the PF
data if VF is not available, and always initialize the variables
to something useful.
