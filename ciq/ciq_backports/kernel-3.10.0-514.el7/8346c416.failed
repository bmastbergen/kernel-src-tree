Commit 46c043ede471 ("mm: take i_mmap_lock in unmap_mapping_range() for
DAX") moved some code in __dax_pmd_fault() that was responsible for
zeroing newly allocated PMD pages.  The new location didn't properly set
up 'kaddr', so when run this code resulted in a NULL pointer BUG.

Fix this by getting the correct 'kaddr' via bdev_direct_access().
