The issue here is that there is a cut and paste bug.  When we allocate
cma_dev_group->default_ports_group we use "sizeof(*cma_dev_group->ports)"
instead of "sizeof(*cma_dev_group->default_ports_group)".

We're bumping up against the 80 character limit so I introduced a new
local pointer "ports_group" to get around that.
