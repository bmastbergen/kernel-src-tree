This drop enables a future card with a device id of 0x0600 to be
recognized by the cxlflash driver.

As per the design, the Accelerator Function Unit (AFU) for this new IBM
CXL Flash Adapter retains the same host interface as the previous
generation. For the early prototypes of the new card, the driver with
this change behaves exactly as the driver prior to this behaved with the
earlier generation card. Therefore, no card specific programming has
been added. These card specific changes can be staged in later if
needed.
