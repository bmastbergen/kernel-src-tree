The MPX code appears is calling a low-level FPU function
(copy_fpregs_to_fpstate()).  This function is not able to
be called in all contexts, although it is safe to call
directly in some cases.

Although probably correct, the current code is ugly and
potentially error-prone.  So, add a wrapper that calls
the (slightly) higher-level fpu__save() (which is preempt-
safe) and also ensures that we even *have* an FPU context
(in the case that this was called when in lazy FPU mode).

Ingo had this to say about the details about when we need
preemption disabled:

> it's indeed generally unsafe to access/copy FPU registers with preemption enabled,
> for two reasons:

>   - on older systems that use FSAVE the instruction destroys FPU register
>     contents, which has to be handled carefully
>
>   - even on newer systems if we copy to FPU registers (which this code doesn't)
>     then we don't want a context switch to occur in the middle of it, because a
>     context switch will write to the fpstate, potentially overwriting our new data
>     with old FPU state.
