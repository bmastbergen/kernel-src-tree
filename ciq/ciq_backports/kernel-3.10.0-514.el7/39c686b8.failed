Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Add support for the three ARS DSM commands:
- Query ARS Capabilities - Queries the firmware to check if a given
  range supports scrub, and if so, which type (persistent vs. volatile)
- Start ARS - Starts a scrub for a given range/type
- Query ARS Status - Checks status of a previously started scrub, and
  provides the error logs if any.

  The commands are described by the example DSM spec at:
  http://pmem.io/documents/NVDIMM_DSM_Interface_Example.pdf

Also add these commands to the nfit_test test framework, and return
canned data.
