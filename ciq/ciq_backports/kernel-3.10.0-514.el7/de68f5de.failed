Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/de68f5de.failed

The declaration of the bitmap vf_req_snif_bmap using fixed array of
unsigned long will only work on 64-bit archs.  Use DECLARE_BITMAP instead
which will work on all archs.
