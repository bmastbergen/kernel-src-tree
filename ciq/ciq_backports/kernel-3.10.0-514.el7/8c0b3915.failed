Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/8c0b3915.failed

The "|" operator has higher precedence than "?:" so this didn't work as
intended.  I had previously fixed this bug, but it we copied the older
unfixed version when we moved the function between files.

Fixes: 1673f1f08c88 ('nvme: move block_device_operations and ns/ctrl freeing to common code')
