Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/685a015e.failed

Depending on system speed, the large lookup/insert/delete loops of the testsuite can
take a considerable amount of time to complete causing watchdog warnings to appear.
Allow other tasks to be scheduled throughout the loops.
