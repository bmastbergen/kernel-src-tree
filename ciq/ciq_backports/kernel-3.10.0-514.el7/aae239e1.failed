Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/aae239e1.failed

Now that all commands are executed as block layer requests we can remove the
internal completion in the NVMe driver.  Note that we can simply call
blk_mq_complete_request to abort commands as the block layer will protect
against double copletions internally.
