Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/fa7e2812.failed

Add detection and recovery code when the hardware returned opaque value
does not match the expected consumer index.  Once the issue is detected,
we skip the processing of all RX and LRO/GRO packets.  These completion
entries are discarded without sending the SKB to the stack and without
producing new buffers.  The function will be reset from a workqueue.
