commit 947df02d255a6a81a3832e831c5ca02078cfd529
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/947df02d.failed

The leading '0x' in front of %pa is redundant, also we can just use %pR
to simplify the print statement.  The request parameters can be directly
taken from the resource as well.
