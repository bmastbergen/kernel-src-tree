Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/de89e854.failed

The ibmvnic_capability struct was defined incorrectly. The last two
elements of the struct are in the wrong order.  In addition, the number
element should be 64-bit. Byteswapping functions are updated
as well.
