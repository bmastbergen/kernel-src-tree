Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/82b95800.failed

A hot-removed CPU may have ID that is numerically larger than the number of
existing CPUs in the system (e.g. we can unplug CPU 4 from a system that
has CPUs 0, 1 and 4).

Thus the WARN_ONs should check whether the CPU in question is currently
present, not whether its ID value is less than num_present_cpus().
