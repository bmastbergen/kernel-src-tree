Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/eee417b0.failed

We need to move freeing of resources to the ->complete handler to ensure
they are also freed when we cancel the command.
