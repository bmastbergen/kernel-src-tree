Update the nfit block I/O path to use the new PMEM API and to adhere to
the read/write flows outlined in the "NVDIMM Block Window Driver
Writer's Guide":

http://pmem.io/documents/NVDIMM_Driver_Writers_Guide.pdf

This includes adding support for targeted NVDIMM flushes called "flush
hints" in the ACPI 6.0 specification:

For performance and media durability the mapping for a BLK aperture is
moved to a write-combining mapping which is consistent with
memcpy_to_pmem() and wmb_blk().
