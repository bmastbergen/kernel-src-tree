If the boot firmware does not support ACPI we need a way to pass device
configuration information to the drivers. The unified device properties API
already supports passing platform data via properties so let's take
advantage of that and allow probe drivers to pass set of properties to the
host controller driver.

In order to do that we need to be able to modify the MFD cell corresponding
the host controller, so make the core driver to take copy of the cell
instead of using it directly. Then we can assign info->pset to the
resulting copy of a cell and let the MFD core to assign that to the
resulting device.
