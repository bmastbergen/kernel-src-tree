Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ad750fa1.failed

If the call to request_firmware() fails in btbcm_setup_patchram(),
the BCM chip will be operating with its default firmware.

In this case, btbcm_setup_patchram() should not return immediately
but instead should skip to btbcm_check_bdaddr() and quirk setup.
