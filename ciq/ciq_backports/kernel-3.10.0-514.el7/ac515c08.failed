Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ac515c08.failed

Now that pmem internals have been disentangled from pfn setup, that code
can move to the core.  This is in preparation for adding another user of
the pfn-device capabilities.
