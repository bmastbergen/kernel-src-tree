Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/a7bebf48.failed

After update_curr_dl() the current task might not be the leftmost task
anymore. In that case do not start a new hrtick for it.

In this case NEED_RESCHED will be set and the next schedule will start
the hrtick for the new task if and when appropriate.
