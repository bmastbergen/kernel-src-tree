Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/ec56151d.failed

When alloc_disk(0) is used ->major is completely ignored, all devices
are allocated with a "major" of BLOCK_EXT_MAJOR.

So don't allocate nd_blk_major
