Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/bfd89471.failed

Make sure we synchronize access to the namespaces list and grab a reference
to the namespace before doing I/O.  Make sure to reject the ioctl if multiple
namespaces are present as it's entirely unsafe, and warn when using it even
with a single namespace.
