commit 877edb347323b669c5c9511cc9e097e1192dd31b
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/877edb34.failed

Add 2 helper functions to set coalescing for each RX and TX rings.  This
will make it easier to expand the number of TX rings per MSIX in the
next patches.
