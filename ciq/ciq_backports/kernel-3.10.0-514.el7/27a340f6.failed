Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/27a340f6.failed

The external device configuration was incorrectly shifted to byte 3 of
the 32 bit DC_HOST_COMM_SETTINGS instead of byte 0. This patch corrects
the shift and provides the cable capability information in byte 0.
