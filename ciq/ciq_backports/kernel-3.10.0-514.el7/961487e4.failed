The calls to pci_request_regions(), pci_resource_start(),
pci_set_dma_mask(), pci_set_master() and pci_save_state() are all
unnecessary for the IBM CXL flash adapter since data buffers
are not required to be mapped to the device's memory.

The use of services such as pci_set_dma_mask() are problematic on
hypervisor managed systems as the IBM CXL flash adapter is operating
under a virtual PCI Host Bridge (virtual PHB) which does not support
these services.

cxlflash 0001:00:00.0: init_pci: Failed to set PCI DMA mask rc=-5

The resolution is to simplify init_pci(), to a point where it does the
bare minimum (pci_enable_device). Similarly, remove the call the
pci_release_regions() from cxlflash_remove().
