Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

If a device will ever have badblocks it should always have a badblocks
instance available.  So, similar to md, embed a badblocks instance in
pmem_device.  This reduces pointer chasing in the i/o fast path, and
simplifies the init path.
