commit 8de5dff8bae634497f4413bc3067389f2ed267da
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/8de5dff8.failed

A bunch of changes that I hope will help in understanding it
better for first-time readers.
