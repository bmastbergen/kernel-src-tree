Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The current code is more complicated than necessary and can only report
unsupported SFP+ module if it is plugged in after the device is up.

Rename bnxt_port_module_event() to bnxt_get_port_module_status().  We
already have the current module_status in the link_info structure, so
just check that and report any unsupported SFP+ module status.  Delete
the unnecessary last_port_module_event.  Call this function at the
end of bnxt_open to report unsupported module already plugged in.
