Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/83cae2af.failed

Pick the QP to use according to the wr.ud.pkey_index field in the work
request. If the QP doesn't exist, it means the P_Key is zero and the packet
would have been dropped, so just generate a completion and move on.
