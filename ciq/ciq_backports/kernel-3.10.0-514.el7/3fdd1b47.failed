commit 3fdd1b479dbc03347e98f904f54133a9cef5521f
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/3fdd1b47.failed

I was basically open-coding it (thanks to copying code from do_fault()
which probably also needs to be fixed).
