Correcting the mutex usage, in client_subtask(), mutex_unlock has
to be called just before client_del_instance() since this function opens
and later closes the same mutex again.
Similarly in client_is_registered removing the mutex since it closes
the mutex twice.

This is a patch suggested by RDMA team.
