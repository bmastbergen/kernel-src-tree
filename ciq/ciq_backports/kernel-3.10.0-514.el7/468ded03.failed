Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/468ded03.failed

Before the dynamically allocated struct pages from devm_memremap_pages()
can be put to use outside the driver, we need a mechanism to track
whether they are still in use at teardown.  Towards that goal reorder
the initialization sequence to allow the 'q_usage_counter' from the
request_queue to be used by the devm_memremap_pages() implementation (in
subsequent patches).
