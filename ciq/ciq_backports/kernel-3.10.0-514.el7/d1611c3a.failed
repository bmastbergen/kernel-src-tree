Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

bnxt_gro_skb() has unused variables when CONFIG_INET is not set.  We
really cannot support hardware GRO if CONFIG_INET is not set, so
compile out bnxt_gro_skb() completely and define BNXT_FLAG_GRO to be 0
if CONFIG_INET is not set.  This will effectively always disable
hardware GRO if CONFIG_INET is not set.
