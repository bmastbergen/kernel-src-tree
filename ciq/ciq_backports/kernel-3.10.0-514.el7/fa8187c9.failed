Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-514.el7/fa8187c9.failed

This private net_device flag can be set by drivers to inform that a
device runs fine without a qdisc attached. This was formerly done by
setting tx_queue_len to zero.

 -/**
 - *	struct net_device - The DEVICE structure.
 - *		Actually, this whole structure is a big mistake.  It mixes I/O
 - *		data with strictly "high-level" data, and it has to know about
 - *		almost every data structure used in the INET module.
 - *
 - *	@name:	This is the first field of the "visible" part of this structure
 - *		(i.e. as seen by users in the "Space.c" file).  It is the name
 - *	 	of the interface.
