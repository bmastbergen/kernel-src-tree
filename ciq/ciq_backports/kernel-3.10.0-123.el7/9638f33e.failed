Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/9638f33e.failed

The ct expression can currently not be used in the inet family since
we don't have a conntrack module for NFPROTO_INET, so
nf_ct_l3proto_try_module_get() fails. Add some manual handling to
load the modules for both NFPROTO_IPV4 and NFPROTO_IPV6 if the
ct expression is used in the inet family.
