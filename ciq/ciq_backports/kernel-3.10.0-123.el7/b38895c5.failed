Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/b38895c5.failed

We have to validate that the input register is in the range of
allowed registers, otherwise we can take a incorrect register
value as input that may lead us to a crash.
