Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/bf751ba8.failed

The following patch sets the skb->rxhash and skb->q_number.
This is used by RPS and RFS. Kernel can make use of hw provided hash
instead of calculating the hash.
