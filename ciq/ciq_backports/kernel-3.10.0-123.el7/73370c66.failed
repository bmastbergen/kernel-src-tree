The post initialization (struct eeh_ops::post_init) is called after
the EEH probe is done. On the other hand, the EEH core post
initialization is designed to call platform and then I/O chip backend
on PowerNV platform.

The patch adds the backend for I/O chip to notify the platform
that the specific PHB is ready to supply EEH service.
