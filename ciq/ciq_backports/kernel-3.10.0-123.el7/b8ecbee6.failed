Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/b8ecbee6.failed

The log and queue expressions both store the family during ->init() and
use it to deliver packets. This is wrong when used in NFPROTO_INET since
they should both deliver to the actual AF of the packet, not the dummy
NFPROTO_INET.

Use the family from the hook ops to fix this.
