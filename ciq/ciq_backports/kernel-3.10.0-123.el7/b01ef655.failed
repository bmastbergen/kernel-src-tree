Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/b01ef655.failed

Rather than hiding the ftype field size accounting inside the dirent
padding for the ".." and first entry offset functions for v2
directory formats, add explicit functions that calculate it
correctly.
