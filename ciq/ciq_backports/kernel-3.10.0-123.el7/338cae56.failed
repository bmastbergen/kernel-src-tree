Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/338cae56.failed

On this machine, DAC on node 0x03 seems to give mono output.

Also, it needs additional patches for headset mic support.
It supports CTIA style headsets only.

Alsa-info available at the bug link below.
