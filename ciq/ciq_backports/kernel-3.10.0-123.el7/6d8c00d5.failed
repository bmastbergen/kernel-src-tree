commit 6d8c00d58e9e484fdc41aaaf62e5d8364efe375a
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/6d8c00d5.failed

It makes no sense to inline a rarely used function meant for debugging
only that is called a total of five times in the main evaluation loop.
