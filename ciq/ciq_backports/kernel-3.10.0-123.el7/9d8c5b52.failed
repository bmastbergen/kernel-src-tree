Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/9d8c5b52.failed

zbud_alloc() incorrectly verifies the size of allocation limit.  It
should deny the allocation request greater than (PAGE_SIZE -
ZHDR_SIZE_ALIGNED - CHUNK_SIZE), not (PAGE_SIZE - ZHDR_SIZE_ALIGNED)
which has no remaining spaces for its buddy.  There is no point in
spending the entire zbud page storing only a single page, since we don't
have any benefits.
