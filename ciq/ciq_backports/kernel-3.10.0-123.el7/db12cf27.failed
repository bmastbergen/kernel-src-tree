Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Since commit 41d73ec053d2 (netfilter: nf_conntrack: make sequence
number adjustments usuable without NAT), the sequence number extension
is dynamically allocated.

Instead of dying, give a WARN splash, in case of wrong usage of the
seqadj code, e.g. when forgetting to allocate via nfct_seqadj_ext_add().

Wrong usage have been seen in the IPVS code path.
