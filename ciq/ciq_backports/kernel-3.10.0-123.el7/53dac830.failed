Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/53dac830.failed

In some cases we enter the cursor code with file_priv = NULL causing an oops,
we also can try to unpin something that isn't pinned, and this is a good fix for it.
