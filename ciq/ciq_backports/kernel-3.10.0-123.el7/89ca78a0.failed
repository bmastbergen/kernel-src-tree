Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/89ca78a0.failed

Add initial ABI documentation for ACPI devices' sysfs interfaces.
Contacts information fields are filled with current ACPI maintainer and the
relevant authors are carbon copied.
