Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/7cb9d93d.failed

The patch registers OPAL event notifier and process the PCI errors
from firmware. If we have pending PCI errors, special EEH event
(without binding PE) will be sent to EEH core for processing.
