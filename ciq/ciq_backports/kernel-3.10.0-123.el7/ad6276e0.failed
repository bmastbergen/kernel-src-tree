Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Our use of sched_clock is OK because we don't mind the side effects
of calling it and occasionally waking up on a different CPU.

When CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is on, disable preempt before calling
sched_clock() so we don't trigger a debug_smp_processor_id() warning.
