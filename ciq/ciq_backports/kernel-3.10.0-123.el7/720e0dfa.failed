Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/720e0dfa.failed

The nfmsg variable is not used (except in sizeof operator which does
not care about its value) between the first and second time it is
assigned the value.  Furthermore, nlmsg_data has no side effects, so
the assignment can be safely removed.
