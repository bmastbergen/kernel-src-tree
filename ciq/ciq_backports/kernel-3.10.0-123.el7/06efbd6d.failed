Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/06efbd6d.failed

There are two checks for CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE, but the corresponding
Kconfig symbol was dropped in v2.6.39. Since the code guards access to
dst_entry.tclassid it seems CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_CLASSID should be used
instead.
