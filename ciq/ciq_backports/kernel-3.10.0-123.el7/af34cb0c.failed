Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Give the root user the ability to read the system keyring and put read
permission on the trusted keys added during boot.  The latter is actually more
theoretical than real for the moment as asymmetric keys do not currently
provide a read operation.
