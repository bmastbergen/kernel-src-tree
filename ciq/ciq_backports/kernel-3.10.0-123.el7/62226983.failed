Apart from data-type specific alignment constraints, there are also
architecture-specific alignment requirements.
For example, on s390 symbols must be on even addresses implying a 2-byte
alignment.  If the system_certificate_list_end symbol is on an odd address
and if this address is loaded, the least-significant bit is ignored.  As a
result, the load_system_certificate_list() fails to load the certificates
because of a wrong certificate length calculation.

To be safe, align system_certificate_list on an 8-byte boundary.  Also improve
the length calculation of the system_certificate_list content.  Introduce a
system_certificate_list_size (8-byte aligned because of unsigned long) variable
that stores the length.  Let the linker calculate this size by introducing
a start and end label for the certificate content.
