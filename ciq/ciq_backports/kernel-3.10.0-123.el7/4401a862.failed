Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-123.el7/4401a862.failed

Chain counter validation is performed after the chain policy has
potentially been changed. Move counter validation/setting before
changing of the chain policy to fix this.

Additionally fix a memory leak if chain counter allocation fails
for new chains, remove an unnecessary free_percpu() and move
counter allocation for new chains
