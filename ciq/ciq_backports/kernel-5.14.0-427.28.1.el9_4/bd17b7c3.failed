commit bd17b7c34fadef645becde1245b9394f69f31702
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-427.28.1.el9_4/bd17b7c3.failed

Decrement the index variable i before the first iteration when freeing
the remaining elements on error. Depending on where this fails it could
free something from one element beyond the end of the fru_records[]
array.
