Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-427.28.1.el9_4/838850c5.failed

The system physical address (SPA) of an error is not a stable value. It
will change depending on the location of the memory: parts can be
swapped. And it will change depending on memory topology: NUMA nodes
and/or interleaving can be adjusted.

Therefore, the SPA value is not part of the "FRU Memory Poison" record
format. And it will not be saved to persistent storage.

However, the SPA values can be helpful during debug and for system
admins during run time.

Save the SPA values in a separate structure. This is updated when
records are restored and when new errors are saved.

    comments. ]
