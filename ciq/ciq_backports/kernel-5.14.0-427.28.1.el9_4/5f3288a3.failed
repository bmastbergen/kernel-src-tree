Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-427.28.1.el9_4/5f3288a3.failed

Both the firmware reset feature and the power management
suspend/resume feature share common power-down and power-up
functionality. One aspect of the power-up functionality is
the handling of the ATH11K_QMI_EVENT_FW_INIT_DONE event.
When this event is received, a call is made to
ath11k_hal_dump_srng_stats(), with the purpose to collect
information that may be useful in debugging the cause of a
firmware reset.

Unfortunately, since this functionality is shared between
both the firmware reset path and the power management
resume path, the kernel log is flooded with messages during
resume. Since these messages are not useful during resume,
and in fact can be confusing and can increase the time it
takes to resume, update the logic to only call
ath11k_hal_dump_srng_stats() during firmware reset.

Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.30
