Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-427.28.1.el9_4/4b0e527c.failed

An old, invalid record should be cleared and skipped.

Currently, the record is cleared in ERST, but it is not skipped. This
leads to a NULL pointer dereference when attempting to copy the old
record to the new record.

Continue the loop after clearing an old, invalid record to skip it.
