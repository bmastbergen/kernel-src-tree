Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-80.el8/6f3dfb0d.failed

use per-CPU counters, instead of sharing a single set of stats with all
cores: this removes the need of spinlocks when stats are read/updated.
