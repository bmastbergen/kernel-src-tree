Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/cf64527b.failed

Letting this pend may cause nested_get_vmcs12_pages to run against an
invalid state, corrupting the effective vmcs of L1.

This was triggerable in QEMU after a guest corruption in L2, followed by
a L1 reset.
