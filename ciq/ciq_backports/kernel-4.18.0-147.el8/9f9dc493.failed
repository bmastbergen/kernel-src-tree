With the introduction of flow_stats_update(), drivers now update the stats
fields of the passed tc_cls_flower_offload struct, rather than call
tcf_exts_stats_update() directly to update the stats of offloaded TC
flower rules. However, if multiple qdiscs are registered to a TC shared
block and a flower rule is applied, then, when getting stats for the rule,
multiple callbacks may be made.

Take this into consideration by modifying flow_stats_update to gather the
stats from all callbacks. Currently, the values in tc_cls_flower_offload
only account for the last stats callback in the list.
