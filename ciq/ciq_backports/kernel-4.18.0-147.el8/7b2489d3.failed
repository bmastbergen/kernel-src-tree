Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/7b2489d3.failed

The current help text caused some confusion in online forums about
whether or not to default-enable or default-disable psi in vendor
kernels.  This is because it doesn't communicate the reason for why we
made this setting configurable in the first place: that the overhead is
non-zero in an artificial scheduler stress test.

Since this isn't representative of real workloads, and the effect was
not measurable in scheduler-heavy real world applications such as the
webservers and memcache installations at Facebook, it's fair to point
out that this is a pretty cautious option to select.

+ 	  Collect metrics that indicate how overcommitted the CPU, memory,
+ 	  and IO capacity are in the system.
+ 
+ 	  If you say Y here, the kernel will create /proc/pressure/ with the
+ 	  pressure statistics files cpu, memory, and io. These will indicate
+ 	  the share of walltime in which some or all tasks in the system are
+ 	  delayed due to contention of the respective resource.
+ 
+ 	  In kernels with cgroup support, cgroups (cgroup2 only) will
+ 	  have cpu.pressure, memory.pressure, and io.pressure files,
+ 	  which aggregate pressure stalls for the grouped tasks only.

+ 	help
+ 	  If set, pressure stall information tracking will be disabled
+ 	  per default but can be enabled through passing psi=1 on the
+ 	  kernel commandline during boot.
+ 
+ 	  This feature adds some code to the task wakeup and sleep
+ 	  paths of the scheduler. The overhead is too low to affect
+ 	  common scheduling-intense workloads in practice (such as
+ 	  webservers, memcache), but it does show up in artificial
+ 	  scheduler stress tests, such as hackbench.
+ 
+ 	  If you are paranoid and not sure what the kernel will be
+ 	  used for, say Y.
