Previously, 'commit f99e3daf94ff ("KVM: x86: Add Intel PT
virtualization work mode")' work mode' offered framework
to support Intel PT virtualization. However, the patch has
some typos in vmx_vmentry_ctrl() and vmx_vmexit_ctrl(), e.g.
used wrong flags and wrong variable, which will cause the
VM entry failure later.
