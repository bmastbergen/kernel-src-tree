Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/359a6c3d.failed

The preemption timer can be started even if there is a vmentry
failure during or after loading guest state.  That is pointless,
move the call after all conditions have been checked.
