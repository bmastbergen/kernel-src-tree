Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/5404a7f1.failed

The test-suite caught these two mistakes when compiled for 32-bit.
I had only been running the test-suite in 64-bit mode.
