Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/f9bc5227.failed

Unfortunately, a couple of mistakes were made while implementing
Enlightened VMCS support, in particular, wrong clean fields were
used in copy_enlightened_to_vmcs12():
- exception_bitmap is covered by CONTROL_EXCPN;
- vm_exit_controls/pin_based_vm_exec_control/secondary_vm_exec_control
  are covered by CONTROL_GRP1.
