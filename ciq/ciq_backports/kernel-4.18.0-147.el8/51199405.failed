Add SK_PASS verdict support to SK_SKB_VERDICT programs. Now that
support for redirects exists we can implement SK_PASS as a redirect
to the same socket. This simplifies the BPF programs and avoids an
extra map lookup on RX path for simple visibility cases.

Further, reduces user (BPF programmer in this context) confusion
when their program drops skb due to lack of support.
