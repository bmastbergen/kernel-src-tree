Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/8229706e.failed

The following sequence of calls would result in an infinite loop in
xa_find_after():

	xa_store(xa, 0, x, GFP_KERNEL);
	index = 0;
	xa_for_each(xa, entry, index, ULONG_MAX, XA_PRESENT) { }

xa_find_after() was confusing the situation where we found no entry in
the tree with finding a multiorder entry, so it would look for the
successor entry forever.  Just check for this case explicitly.  Includes
a few new checks in the test suite to be sure this doesn't reappear.
