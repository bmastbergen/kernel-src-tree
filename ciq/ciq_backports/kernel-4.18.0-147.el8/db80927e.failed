Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/db80927e.failed

The offset for reading the shadow VMCS is sizeof(*kvm_state)+VMCS12_SIZE,
so the correct size must be that plus sizeof(*vmcs12).  This could lead
to KVM reading garbage data from userspace and not reporting an error,
but is otherwise not sensitive.
