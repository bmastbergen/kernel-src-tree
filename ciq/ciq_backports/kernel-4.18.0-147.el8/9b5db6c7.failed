Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/9b5db6c7.failed

nested_run_pending=1 implies we have successfully entered guest mode.
Move setting from external state in vmx_set_nested_state() until after
all other checks are complete.

Based on a patch by Aaron Lewis.
