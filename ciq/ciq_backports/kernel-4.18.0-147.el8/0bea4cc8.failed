Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/0bea4cc8.failed

The ASUS UX433FN and UX333FA with ALC294 cannot detect the headset MIC
and output through the internal speaker and the headphone until
ALC294_FIXUP_ASUS_SPK and ALC294_FIXUP_ASUS_HEADSET_MIC quirk applied.
