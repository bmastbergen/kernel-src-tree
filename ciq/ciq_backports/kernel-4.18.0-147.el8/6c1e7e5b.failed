Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/6c1e7e5b.failed

Using %1 to reference RCX, i.e. the 'vmx' pointer', is obtuse and
fragile, e.g. it results in cryptic and infurating compile errors if the
output constraints are touched by anything more than a gentle breeze.
