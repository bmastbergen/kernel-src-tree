Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/98ff2acc.failed

...as it doesn't technically actually do anything non-standard with the
stack even though it modifies RSP in a weird way.  E.g. RSP is loaded
with VMCS.HOST_RSP if the VM-Enter gets far enough to trigger VM-Exit,
but it's simply reloaded with the current value.
