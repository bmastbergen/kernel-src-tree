Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

We need to set the error message on this path otherwise some of the
callers, such as test_hints_case(), print from an uninitialized pointer.

We had a similar bug earlier and set "errmsg" to NULL in the caller,
test_delta_action_item().  That code is no longer required so I have
removed it.
