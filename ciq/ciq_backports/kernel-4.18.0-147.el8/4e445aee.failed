Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/4e445aee.failed

.. to improve readability and maintainability, and to align the code as per
the layout of the checks in chapter "VM Entries" in Intel SDM vol 3C.
