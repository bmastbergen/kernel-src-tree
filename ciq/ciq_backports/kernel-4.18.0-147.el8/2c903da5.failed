Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/2c903da5.failed

CFL:C0+ changed the status of those registers which are now
blacklisted by default.

This is breaking a number of CTS tests on GL & Vulkan :

  KHR-GL45.pipeline_statistics_query_tests_ARB.functional_fragment_shader_invocations (GL)

  dEQP-VK.query_pool.statistics_query.fragment_shader_invocations.* (Vulkan)

v2: Only use one whitelist entry (Lionel)
