Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/d69d287a.failed

We do not currently check that the loop in xas_squash_marks() doesn't have
an off-by-one error in it.  It didn't, but a patch which introduced an
off-by-one error wasn't caught by any existing test.  Switch the roles
of XA_MARK_1 and XA_MARK_2 to catch that bug.
