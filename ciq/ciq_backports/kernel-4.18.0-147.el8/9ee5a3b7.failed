commit 9ee5a3b7eeb190eb413e0fac3246022bd1baa05d
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/9ee5a3b7.failed

Without this, it's not possible to use static inlines like xa_store_bh()
and xa_erase_irq().
