Apparently, Windows doesn't maintain clean fields data after it does
VMCLEAR for an enlightened VMCS so we can only use it on VMRESUME.
The issue went unnoticed because currently we do nested_release_evmcs()
in handle_vmclear() and the consecutive enlightened VMPTRLD invalidates
clean fields when a new eVMCS is mapped but we're going to change the
logic.
