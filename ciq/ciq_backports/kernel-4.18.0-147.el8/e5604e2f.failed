Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/e5604e2f.failed

On ICL the DMC doesn't reinit combo PHY B so we should not warn
about its state being bogus during the display core uninit.
