Before the new mlx5 event notification infrastructure and API,
mlx5_core used to process all events before forwarding them to mlx5
interfaces (mlx5e/mlx5_ib) and used to translate the event type enum
to a software defined enum, this is not needed anymore since it is ok
for mlx5e and mlx5_ib to receive FW events as is, at least the few ones
mlx5 core allows.

mlx5e and mlx5_ib already moved to use the new API and they only handle FW
events types, it is now safe to remove all equivalent software defined
events and the logic around them.
