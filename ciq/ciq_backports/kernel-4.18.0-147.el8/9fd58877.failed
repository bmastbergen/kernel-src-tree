Commit 332d079735f5 ("KVM: nVMX: KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE - Tear down old EVMCS
state before setting new state", 2019-05-02) broke evmcs_test because the
eVMCS setup must be performed even if there is no VMXON region defined,
as long as the eVMCS bit is set in the assist page.

While the simplest possible fix would be to add a check on
kvm_state->flags & KVM_STATE_NESTED_EVMCS in the initial "if" that
covers kvm_state->hdr.vmx.vmxon_pa == -1ull, that is quite ugly.

Instead, this patch moves checks earlier in the function and
conditionalizes them on kvm_state->hdr.vmx.vmxon_pa, so that
vmx_set_nested_state always goes through vmx_leave_nested
and nested_enable_evmcs.
