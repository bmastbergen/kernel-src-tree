Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/bc441211.failed

A recently added preemption timer consistency check was unintentionally
dropped when the consistency checks were being reorganized to match the
SDM's ordering.

Fixes: 461b4ba4c7ad ("KVM: nVMX: Move the checks for VM-Execution Control Fields to a separate helper function")
