As part of creating the tunnel headers while offloading TC encap rules,
we resolve the route and neighbour in order to get the source /
destination mac.

Since the way we offload multipath route is by having two HW rules,
one per uplink port, doing naive route lookup might get us a "wrong"
routing path which goes through the peer uplink and this will get us
eventually to create a wrong L2 header for the tunnel.

To avoid that, we use a device hint to get the correct route.
