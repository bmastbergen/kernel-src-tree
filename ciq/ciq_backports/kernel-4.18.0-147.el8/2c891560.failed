Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/2c891560.failed

Register a separate handler per event type, rather than listening for all
events and looking for the events to handle in a switch case.
