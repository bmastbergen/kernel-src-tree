Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/48483614.failed

Specifying a starting ID greater than the maximum ID isn't something
attempted very often, but it should fail.  It was succeeding due to
xas_find_marked() returning the wrong error state, so add tests for
both xa_alloc() and xas_find_marked().
