Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/44a4a66b.failed

The explicit '64' should have been BITS_PER_LONG, but while looking at
this code I realised I meant to use __ffs(), not ilog2().
