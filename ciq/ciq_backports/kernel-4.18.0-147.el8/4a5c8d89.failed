Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/4a5c8d89.failed

If we reserve index 0, the next entry to be stored there might be 2-byte
aligned.  That means we have to create the root xa_node at the time of
reserving the initial entry.
