Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/a136678c.failed

In addition to releasing any cork'ed data on a psock when the psock
is removed we should also release any skb's in the ingress work queue.
Otherwise the skb's eventually get free'd but late in the tear
down process so we see the WARNING due to non-zero sk_forward_alloc.

  void sk_stream_kill_queues(struct sock *sk)
  {
	...
	WARN_ON(sk->sk_forward_alloc);
	...
  }
