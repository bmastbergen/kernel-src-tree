Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/4f44c4ee.failed

Move the clearing of the common registers (not 64-bit-only) to the start
of the flow that clears registers holding guest state.  This is
purely a cosmetic change so that the label doesn't point at a blank line
and a #define.

No functional change intended.
