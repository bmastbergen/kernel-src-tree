commit 3fe0107e45ab396342497e06b8924cdd485cde3b
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/3fe0107e.failed

The same tests failing on CFL+ platforms are also failing on ICL.
Documentation doesn't list the
WaAllowPMDepthAndInvocationCountAccessFromUMD workaround for ICL but
applying it fixes the same tests as CFL.

v2: Use only one whitelist entry (Lionel)
