Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/333f3017.failed

Introduce changed_states parameter into collect_percpu_times to track
the states changed since the last update.

This will be needed to detect whether polled states activated in the
monitor patch.
