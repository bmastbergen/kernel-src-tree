Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/c7bcb277.failed

Change the order to first route IPv4/6 and return if error. Only after
successful route continue to allocate an encap header, with no
functional change.
