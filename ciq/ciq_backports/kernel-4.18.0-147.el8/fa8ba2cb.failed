It is possible that there might be an originally parent object with 0
direct users that is in hints no longer considered as parent. Then the
weight of this object is 0 and current code ignores him. That's why the
total amount of hint objects might be lower than for the original
objagg and WARN_ON is hit. Fix this be considering 0 weight valid.
