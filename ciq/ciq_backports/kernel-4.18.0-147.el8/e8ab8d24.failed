Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/e8ab8d24.failed

The size checks in vmx_nested_state are wrong because the calculations
are made based on the size of a pointer to a struct kvm_nested_state
rather than the size of a struct kvm_nested_state.
