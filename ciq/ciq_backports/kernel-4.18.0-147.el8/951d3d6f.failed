Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/951d3d6f.failed

There is a typo here.  We intended to check "objagg2" but we instead
test "objagg" which is not an error pointer.
