Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/8f220c41.failed

When the initial discovery fails the subsystem hasn't been setup yet
in nvme_mpath_stop, and we can't dereference ctrl->subsys.
