Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/58f7c0bf.failed

The "num_actions" variable needs to be signed for the error handling to
work.  The maximum number of actions is less than 256 so int type is large
enough for that.

Fixes: cbfdd442c43e ("IB/uverbs: Add helper to get array size from ptr attribute")
