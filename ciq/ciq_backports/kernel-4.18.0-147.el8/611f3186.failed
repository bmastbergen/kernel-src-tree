Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/611f3186.failed

Saves around 115 bytes on a tinyconfig build and reduces the amount
of code duplication in the XArray implementation.
