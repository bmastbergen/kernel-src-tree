Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

inotify_show_fdinfo() is defined in fs/notify/fdinfo.c and declared in
fs/notify/fdinfo.h, but the declaration isn't included at the point of
the definition.  Include the header to enforce that the definition
matches the declaration.

This addresses a gcc warning when -Wmissing-prototypes is enabled.
