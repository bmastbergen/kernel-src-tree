Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-147.el8/e0dfacbf.failed

VMX is only accessible in protected mode, remove a confusing check
that causes the conditional to lack a final "else" branch.
