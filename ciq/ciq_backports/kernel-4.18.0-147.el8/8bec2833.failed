These actions need to be added to support the ethtool_rx_flow interface.
The queue action includes a field to specify the RSS context, that is
set via FLOW_RSS flow type flag and the rss_context field in struct
ethtool_rxnfc, plus the corresponding queue index. FLOW_RSS implies that
rss_context is non-zero, therefore, queue.ctx == 0 means that FLOW_RSS
was not set. Also add a field to store the vf index which is stored in
the ethtool_rxnfc ring_cookie field.
