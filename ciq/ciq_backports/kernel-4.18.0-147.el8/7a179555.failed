The idea is to allow mlx5 core interfaces (mlx5e/mlx5_ib) to be able to
receive some allowed FW events as is via the new notifier API.

In this patch we allow forwarding port change event to mlx5 core interfaces
(mlx5e/mlx5_ib) as it was received from FW.
Once mlx5e and mlx5_ib start using this event we can safely remove the
redundant software version of it and its translation logic.
