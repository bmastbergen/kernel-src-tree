Implement the ability for filesystems to log error, warning and
informational messages through the fs_context.  In the future, these will
be extractable by userspace by reading from an fd created by the fsopen()
syscall.

Error messages are prefixed with "e ", warnings with "w " and informational
messages with "i ".

In the future, inside the kernel, formatted messages will be malloc'd but
unformatted messages will not copied if they're either in the core .rodata
section or in the .rodata section of the filesystem module pinned by
fs_context::fs_type.  The messages will only be good till the fs_type is
released.

Note that the logging object will be shared between duplicated fs_context
structures.  This is so that such as NFS which do a mount within a mount
can get at least some of the errors from the inner mount.

Five logging functions are provided for this:

 (1) void logfc(struct fs_context *fc, const char *fmt, ...);

     This logs a message into the context.  If the buffer is full, the
     earliest message is discarded.

 (2) void errorf(fc, fmt, ...);

     This wraps logfc() to log an error.

 (3) void invalf(fc, fmt, ...);

     This wraps errorf() and returns -EINVAL for convenience.

 (4) void warnf(fc, fmt, ...);

     This wraps logfc() to log a warning.

 (5) void infof(fc, fmt, ...);

     This wraps logfc() to log an informational message.
