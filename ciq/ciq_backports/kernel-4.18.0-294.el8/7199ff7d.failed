Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/7199ff7d.failed

Currently, kheaders_data.tar.xz contains some build scripts as well as
headers. None of them is needed in the header archive.

For ARCH=x86, this commit excludes the following from the archive:

  arch/x86/include/asm/Kbuild
  arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/Kbuild
  include/asm-generic/Kbuild
  include/config/auto.conf
  include/config/kernel.release
  include/config/tristate.conf
  include/uapi/asm-generic/Kbuild
  include/uapi/Kbuild
  kernel/gen_kheaders.sh

This change is actually motivated for the planned header compile-testing
because it will generate more build artifacts, which should not be
included in the archive.
