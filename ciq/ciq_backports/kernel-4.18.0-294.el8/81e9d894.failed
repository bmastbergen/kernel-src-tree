Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/81e9d894.failed

When allocating DMA memory from a pool, the core can only guess which
atomic pool will fit a device's constraints. If it doesn't, get a safer
atomic pool and try again.
