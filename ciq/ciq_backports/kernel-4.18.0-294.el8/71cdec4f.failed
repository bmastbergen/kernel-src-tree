When a DMA coherent pool is depleted, allocation failures may or may not
get reported in the kernel log depending on the allocator.

The admin does have a workaround, however, by using coherent_pool= on the
kernel command line.

Provide some guidance on the failure and a recommended minimum size for
the pools (double the size).
