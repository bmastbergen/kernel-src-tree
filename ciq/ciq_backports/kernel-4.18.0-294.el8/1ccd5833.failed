Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Some systems have rp_filter=1 as default configuration. This breaks
bareudp.sh as the intermediate namespaces handle part of the routing
with regular IPv4 routes but the reverse path is done with tc
(flower/tunnel_key/mirred).
