Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The generic VDSO implementation uses the Y2038 safe clock_gettime64() and
clock_getres_time64() syscalls as fallback for 32bit VDSO. This breaks
seccomp setups because these syscalls might be not (yet) allowed.

Implement the 32bit variants which use the legacy syscalls and select the
variant in the core library.

The 64bit time variants are not removed because they are required for the
time64 based vdso accessors.
