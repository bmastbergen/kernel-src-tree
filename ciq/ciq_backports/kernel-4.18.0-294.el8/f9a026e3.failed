Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/f9a026e3.failed

With VHE and nVHE executable code completely separated, remove build config
that disabled GCOV/KASAN/UBSAN/KCOV instrumentation for VHE as these now
execute under the same memory mappings as the rest of the kernel.

No violations are currently being reported by either KASAN or UBSAN.
