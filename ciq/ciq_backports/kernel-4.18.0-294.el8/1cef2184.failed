This is necessary because unless userspace explicitly requests fstype
"nfs4" (either via "mount -t nfs4" or by calling the "mount.nfs4" helper
directly), the fstype will default to "nfs".

This was fine on older kernels because the super_block->s_type was set
via mount_info->nfs_mod->nfs_fs, which was set when parsing the mount
options and subsequently passed in the "type" argument of sget().

After commit f2aedb713c28 ("NFS: Add fs_context support."), sget_fc(),
which has no "type" argument, is called instead.  In sget_fc(), the
super_block->s_type is set via fs_context->fs_type, which was set when
the filesystem context was initially created.
