Use change upper event to detect slave representor from
enslaving/unslaving to/from lag device.

On enslaving event, call mlx5_enslave_rep() API to create, add
this slave representor shadow entry to the slaves list of
bond_metadata structure representing master lag device and use
its metadata to setup ingress acl metadata header.

On unslaving event, resetting the vport of unslaved representor
to use its default ingress/egress acls and rx rules with its
default_metadata.

The last slave will free the shared bond_metadata and its
unique metadata.
