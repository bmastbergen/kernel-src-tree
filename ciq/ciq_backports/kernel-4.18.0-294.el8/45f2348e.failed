Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/45f2348e.failed

Divide the dax memory range into fixed size ranges (2MB for now) and put
them in a list. This will track free ranges. Once an inode requires a
free range, we will take one from here and put it in interval-tree
of ranges assigned to inode.
