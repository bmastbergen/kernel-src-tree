commit 9896a4574ecb137d4e5b9283004aa34c688bc761
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/9896a457.failed

Given that it takes time to run a cable test, send a notify message at
the start, as well as when it is completed.

v3:
EMSGSIZE when ethnl_bcastmsg_put() fails
Print an error message on failure, since this is a void function.
