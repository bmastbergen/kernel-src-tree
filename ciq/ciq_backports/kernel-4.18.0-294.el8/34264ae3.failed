commit 34264ae3fa22429ec4fd9151602342d1f21486eb
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/34264ae3.failed

Have the arrays of constant_table self-terminated (by NULL ->name
in the final entry).  Simplifies lookup_constant() and allows to
reuse the search for enum params as well.
