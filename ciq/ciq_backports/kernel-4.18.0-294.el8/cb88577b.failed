A few of the lists used in the linked-list KUnit tests (the
for_each_entry{,_reverse} tests) are declared 'static', and so are
not-reinitialised if the test runs multiple times. This was not a
problem when KUnit tests were run once on startup, but when tests are
able to be run manually (e.g. from debugfs[1]), this is no longer the
case.

Making these lists no longer 'static' causes the lists to be
reinitialised, and the test passes each time it is run. While there may
be some value in testing that initialising static lists works, the
for_each_entry_* tests are unlikely to be the right place for it.
