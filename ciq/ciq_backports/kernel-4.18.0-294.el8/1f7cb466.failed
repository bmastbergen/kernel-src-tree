Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/1f7cb466.failed

BIOS sets incorrect value (zero) when SET value passed for integer
attribute with + sign. Added workaround to remove + sign before passing
input to BIOS.
