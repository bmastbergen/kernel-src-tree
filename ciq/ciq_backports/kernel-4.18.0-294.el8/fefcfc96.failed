Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The whole point behind adding driver_deferred_probe_force_trigger() in
commit 716a7a259690 ("driver core: fw_devlink: Add support for batching
fwnode parsing") was to skip the check for driver_deferred_probe_enable.
Otherwise, it's identical to driver_deferred_probe_trigger().

Delete the check in driver_deferred_probe_force_trigger() so that
fw_devlink_pause() and fw_devlink_resume() can kick off deferred probe
as intended. Without doing this forced deferred probe trigger, some
platforms seem to be crashing during boot because they assume probe
order of devices.
