Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/febeb6df.failed

On systems with recent enough glibc, reallocarray compat won't kick in, so
reallocarray() itself has to come from stdlib.h include. But _GNU_SOURCE is
necessary to enable it. So add it.
