Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/674d3ab9.failed

The only usages of mptcp_pm_ops is to assign its address to the small_ops
field of the genl_family struct, which is a const pointer, and applying
ARRAY_SIZE() on it. Make it const to allow the compiler to put it in
read-only memory.
