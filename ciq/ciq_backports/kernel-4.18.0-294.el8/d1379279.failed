Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/d1379279.failed

The assignment of the PCI device multifunction attribute
is set during the PCI device probe.
There is no need to set it here.

Let's do it right and remove this assignment.
