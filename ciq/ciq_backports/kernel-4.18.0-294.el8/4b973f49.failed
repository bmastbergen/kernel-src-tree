Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/4b973f49.failed

A last minute change put the TDR cable test parameters into a nest.
The validation is not sufficient, resulting in an oops if the nest is
missing. Set default values first, then update them if the nest is
provided.
