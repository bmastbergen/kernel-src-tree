Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/22a214e4.failed

Instead of disabling only first watchpoint, disable all available
watchpoints while clearing dawr_force_enable.

Callback function is used only for disabling watchpoint, rename it
to disable_dawrs_cb(). And null_brk parameter is not really required
while disabling watchpoint, remove it.
