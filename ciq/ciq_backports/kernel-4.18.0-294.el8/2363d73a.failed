Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/2363d73a.failed

As pointed out by Jakub Kicinski, we ethtool netlink code should respond
with an error if request head has flags set which are not recognized by
kernel, either as a mistake or because it expects functionality introduced
in later kernel versions.

To avoid unnecessary roundtrips, use extack cookie to provide the
information about supported request flags.
