Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/20f67902.failed

Calling release_attributes_data() while holding the "wmi_priv.mutex"
will lead to a dead lock.  The other problem is that if kzalloc() fails
then this should return -ENOMEM but currently it returns success.
