Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/aa3367c9.failed

UDP was originally disabled in 6da1a034362f for NFSv4. Later in
b24ee6c64ca7 UDP is by default disabled by NFS_DISABLE_UDP_SUPPORT=y for
all NFS versions. Therefore remove v4 from error message.

Fixes: b24ee6c64ca7 ("NFS: allow deprecation of NFS UDP protocol")
