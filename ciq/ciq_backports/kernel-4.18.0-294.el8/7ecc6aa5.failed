Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/7ecc6aa5.failed

The documentation of rw_semaphores is wrong as it claims that the non-owner
reader release is not supported by RT. That's just history biased memory
distortion.

Split the 'Owner semantics' section up and add separate sections for
semaphore and rw_semaphore to reflect reality.

Aside of that the following updates are done:

 - Add pseudo code to document the spinlock state preserving mechanism on
   PREEMPT_RT

 - Wordsmith the bitspinlock and lock nesting sections
