Return EINVAL rather than ERANGE for mount parse errors as the userspace
mount command doesn't necessarily understand what to do with anything other
than EINVAL.

The old code returned -ERANGE as an intermediate error that then get
converted to -EINVAL, whereas the new code returns -ERANGE.

This was induced by passing minorversion=1 to a v4 mount where
CONFIG_NFS_V4_1 was disabled in the kernel build.
