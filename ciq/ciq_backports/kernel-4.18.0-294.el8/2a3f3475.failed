commit 2a3f34750b8b07df42ab4b30b70e029d46e0d7f3
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/2a3f3475.failed

Rename DPM_FLAG_LEAVE_SUSPENDED to DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME which
matches its purpose more closely.

No functional impact.
