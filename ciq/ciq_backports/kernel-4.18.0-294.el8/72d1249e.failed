STATX_ATTR_MOUNT_ROOT and STATX_ATTR_DAX got merged with the same value,
so one of them needs fixing.  Move STATX_ATTR_DAX.

While we're in here, clarify the value-matching scheme for some of the
attributes, and explain why the value for DAX does not match.

Fixes: 712b2698e4c0 ("fs/stat: Define DAX statx attribute")
