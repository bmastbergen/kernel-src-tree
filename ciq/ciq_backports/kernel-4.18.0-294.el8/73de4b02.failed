Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Card related function should be implemented at soc-card now.
This patch adds it.

One note here is that card has "card->probe" and "card->late_probe"
callbacks.
Because it needs to care "late_probe", "card->probed" flag is set
under if (card->probe) at snd_soc_card_probe().
