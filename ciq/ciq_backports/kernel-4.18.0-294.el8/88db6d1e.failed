Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Unlike other SET type commands, modifying netdev features is required to
provide a reply telling userspace what was actually changed, compared to
what was requested. For that purpose, the "modified" flag provided by
ethnl_update_bitset() is not sufficient, we need full information which
bits were requested to change.

Therefore provide ethnl_parse_bitset() returning effective value and mask
bitmaps equivalent to the contents of a bitset nested attribute.

v2: use non-atomic __set_bit() (suggested by David Miller)
