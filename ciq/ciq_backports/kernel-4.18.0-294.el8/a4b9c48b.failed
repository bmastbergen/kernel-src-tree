Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/a4b9c48b.failed

The sgx_enclave_add_pages.length field is documented as

 * @length:     length of the data (multiple of the page size)

Fail with -EINVAL, when the caller gives a zero length buffer of data
to be added as pages to an enclave. Right now 'ret' is returned as
uninitialized in that case.
