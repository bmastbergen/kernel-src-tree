Currently, ethtool-netlink calculates new wanted bits as:
(req_wanted & req_mask) | (old_active & ~req_mask)

It completely discards the old wanted bits, so they are forgotten with
the next ethtool command. Sample steps to reproduce:

1. ethtool -k eth0
   tx-tcp-segmentation: on # TSO is on from the beginning
2. ethtool -K eth0 tx off
   tx-tcp-segmentation: off [not requested]
3. ethtool -k eth0
   tx-tcp-segmentation: off [requested on]
4. ethtool -K eth0 rx off # Some change unrelated to TSO
5. ethtool -k eth0
   tx-tcp-segmentation: off # "Wanted on" is forgotten

This commit fixes it by changing the formula to:
(req_wanted & req_mask) | (old_wanted & ~req_mask),
where old_active was replaced by old_wanted to account for the wanted
bits.

The shortcut condition for the case where nothing was changed now
compares wanted bitmasks, instead of wanted to active.
