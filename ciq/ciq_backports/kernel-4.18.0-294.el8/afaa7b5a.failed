VDSO support for Time namespace needs to set up a page with the same
layout as VVAR. That timens page will be placed on position of VVAR page
inside namespace. That page contains time namespace clock offsets and it
has vdso_data->seq set to 1 to enforce the slow path and
vdso_data->clock_mode set to VCLOCK_TIMENS to enforce the time namespace
handling path.

Allocate the timens page during namespace creation. Setup the offsets
when the first task enters the ns and freeze them to guarantee the pace
of monotonic/boottime clocks and to avoid breakage of applications.

The design decision is to have a global offset_lock which is used during
namespace offsets setup and to freeze offsets when the first task joins the
new time namespace. That is better in terms of memory usage compared to
having a per namespace mutex that's used only during the setup period.
