Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Add a new command line option (e.g. random=1) and sysfs attribute that
causes subsequent command completion times to be between the current
command delay setting and 0. A uniformly distributed 32 bit, kernel
provided integer is used for this purpose.

Since the existing 'delay' whose units are jiffies (typically milliseconds)
and 'ndelay' (units: nanoseconds) options (and sysfs attributes) span a
range greater than 32 bits, some scaling is required.

The purpose of this patch is to widen the range of testing cases that are
visited in long running tests. Put simply: rarely struct race conditions
are more likely to be found when this facility is used.

The default is the previous case in which all command completions were
roughly equal to (if not, slightly longer) than the value given by the
'delay' or 'ndelay' settings (or their defaults).  This option's default is
equivalent to setting 'random=0' .
