Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/f276031b.failed

This comment block explains why include/generated/compile.h is omitted,
but nothing about include/generated/autoconf.h, which might be more
difficult to understand. Add more comments.
