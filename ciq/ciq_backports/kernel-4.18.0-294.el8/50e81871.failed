Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Jumping out of line for the TSC clcoksource read is creating awful
code. TSC is likely to be the clocksource at least on bare metal and the PV
interfaces are sufficiently more work that the jump over the TSC read is
just in the noise.
