Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

For s390 we can have VFs that are passed-through without the associated
PF. Firmware provides an emulation layer to allow these devices to
operate independently, but is missing emulation of the Memory Space
Enable bit.  For these as well as linked VFs, set no_command_memory
which specifies these devices do not implement PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY.
