Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/a2d0171a.failed

Implement a handler for #VC exceptions caused by #AC exceptions. The
#AC exception is just forwarded to do_alignment_check() and not pushed
down to the hypervisor, as requested by the SEV-ES GHCB Standardization
Specification.
