When kernel is compiled with CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT=N, user can
still create watchpoint using PPC_PTRACE_SETHWDEBUG, with limited
functionalities. But, such watchpoints are never firing because of
the missing privilege settings. Fix that.

It's safe to set HW_BRK_TYPE_PRIV_ALL because we don't really leak
any kernel address in signal info. Setting HW_BRK_TYPE_PRIV_ALL will
also help to find scenarios when kernel accesses user memory.
