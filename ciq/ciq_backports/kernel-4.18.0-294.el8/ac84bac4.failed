While the explanation for time namespace <-> vdso interactions is very
helpful it uses the wrong name in the comment when describing the clock
mode making grepping a bit annoying.

This seems like an accidental oversight when moving from VCLOCK_TIMENS
to VDSO_CLOCKMODE_TIMENS. It seems that
660fd04f9317 ("lib/vdso: Prepare for time namespace support") misspelled
VCLOCK_TIMENS as VLOCK_TIMENS which explains why it got missed when
VCLOCK_TIMENS became VDSO_CLOCKMODE_TIMENS in
2d6b01bd88cc ("lib/vdso: Move VCLOCK_TIMENS to vdso_clock_modes").

Update the comment to use VDSO_CLOCKMODE_TIMENS.

Fixes: 660fd04f9317 ("lib/vdso: Prepare for time namespace support")
Fixes: 2d6b01bd88cc ("lib/vdso: Move VCLOCK_TIMENS to vdso_clock_modes")

+  * @seq to 1 and @clock_mode to VDSO_CLOCKMODE_TIMENS to force the code into
+  * the time namespace slow path. The namespace aware functions retrieve the
+  * real system wide VVAR page, read host time and add the per clock offset.
+  * For clocks which are not affected by time namespace adjustment the
+  * offset must be zero.
