Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/b000def2.failed

The test_overhead prog_test included an fmod_ret program that attached to
__set_task_comm() in the kernel. However, this function was never listed as
allowed for return modification, so this only worked because of the
verifier skipping tests when a trampoline already existed for the attach
point. Now that the verifier checks have been fixed, remove fmod_ret from
the test so it works again.
