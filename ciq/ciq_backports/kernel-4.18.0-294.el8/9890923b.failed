Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/9890923b.failed

The Mellanox BlueField I2C controller is only present on Mellanox
BlueField SoCs.  Hence add a dependency on MELLANOX_PLATFORM, to prevent
asking the user about this driver when configuring a kernel without
Mellanox platform support.
