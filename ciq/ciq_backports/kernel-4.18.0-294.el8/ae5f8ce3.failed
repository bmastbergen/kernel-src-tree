commit ae5f8ce3c247b8d937782e76802a9036c09998ad
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/ae5f8ce3.failed

The UV NMI MMR addresses and fields moved between UV4 and UV5
necessitating a rewrite of the UV NMI handler.  Adjust references
to accommodate those changes.
