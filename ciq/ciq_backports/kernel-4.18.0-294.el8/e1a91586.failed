This is an eventual replacement for vfs_submount() uses.  Unlike the
"mount" and "remount" cases, the users of that thing are not in VFS -
they are buried in various ->d_automount() instances and rather than
converting them all at once we introduce the (thankfully small and
simple) infrastructure here and deal with the prospective users in
afs, nfs, etc. parts of the series.

Here we just introduce a new constructor (fs_context_for_submount())
along with the corresponding enum constant to be put into fc->purpose
for those.
