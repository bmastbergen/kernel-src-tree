Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/57ee58e3.failed

If archs don't have memmove then the C implementation from lib/string.c is used,
and then it's instrumented by compiler. So there is no need to add KASAN's
memmove to manual checks.
