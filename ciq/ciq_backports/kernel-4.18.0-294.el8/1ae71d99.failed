Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/1ae71d99.failed

When getting SQI or maximum SQI value fails in linkstate_prepare_data(), we
must not return without calling ethnl_ops_complete(dev) as that could
result in imbalance between ethtool_ops ->begin() and ->complete() calls.
