"If the MBA is specified in MB then user can enter the max b/w in MB"
is a tautology. How can the user know if the schemata takes a percentage
or a MB/s value?

This is referring to whether the software controller is interpreting
the schemata's value. Make this clear.

  In the above example the tasks in "p1" and "p0" on socket 0 would use a max b/w
  of 1024MB where as on socket 1 they would use 500MB.
