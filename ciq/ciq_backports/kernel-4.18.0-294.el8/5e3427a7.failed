Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/5e3427a7.failed

When a #VC exception is triggered by user-space, the instruction decoder
needs to read the instruction bytes from user addresses. Enhance
vc_decode_insn() to safely fetch kernel and user instructions.
