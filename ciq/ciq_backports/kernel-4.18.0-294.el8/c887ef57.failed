commit c887ef5707591e84f80271e95e99ff9fb38987b5
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/c887ef57.failed

Since the previous commit that saves the value of FSCR configured at
boot into init_task.thread.fscr, the static initialisation in
INIT_THREAD now no longer has any effect.

So remove it.

For non DT CPU features, the end result is the same, because
__init_FSCR() is called on all CPUs that have an FSCR (Power8,
Power9), and it sets FSCR_TAR & FSCR_EBB.
