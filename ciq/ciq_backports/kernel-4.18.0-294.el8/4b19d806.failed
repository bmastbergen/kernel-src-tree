Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/4b19d806.failed

Few wrapper functions are useless and can be inlined. So
delete mlxbf_i2c_read() and mlxbf_i2c_write() and replace
them with readl() and writel(), respectively. Also delete
mlxbf_i2c_read_data() and mlxbf_i2c_write() and replace
them with ioread32be() and iowrite32be(), respectively.
