Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/8b4ce837.failed

Implement a handler for #VC exceptions caused by INVD instructions.
Since Linux should never use INVD, just mark it as unsupported.
