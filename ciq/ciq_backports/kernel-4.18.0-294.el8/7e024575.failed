Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/7e024575.failed

Use the dma_need_sync helper instead of (not always entirely correctly)
poking into the dma-mapping internals.
