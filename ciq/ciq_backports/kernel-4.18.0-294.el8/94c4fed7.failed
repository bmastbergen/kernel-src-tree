Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/94c4fed7.failed

The spinlock only needed when accessing the channel's icosq, grab the lock
after the buf allocation in resync_post_get_progress_params() to avoid
kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL) in atomic context.
