commit 317e5ec3ecaaa2d461d3044eb6cb9cc3a59de2f2
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/317e5ec3.failed

Update the copyright notice in intel_idle.c to cover the recent
changes, drop the description of a "known limitation" that is not
a limitation any more and bump up the driver version number.

No functional impact.
