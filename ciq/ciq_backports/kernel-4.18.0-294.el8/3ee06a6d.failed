On systems with at least 32 MiB, but less than 32 GiB of RAM, the DMA
memory pools are much larger than intended (e.g. 2 MiB instead of 128
KiB on a 256 MiB system).

Fix this by correcting the calculation of the number of GiBs of RAM in
the system.  Invert the order of the min/max operations, to keep on
calculating in pages until the last step, which aids readability.
