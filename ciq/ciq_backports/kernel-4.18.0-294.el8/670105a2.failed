"howaboutsynergy" reported via kernel buzilla number 204165 that
compact_zone_order was consuming 100% CPU during a stress test for
prolonged periods of time.  Specifically the following command, which
should exit in 10 seconds, was taking an excessive time to finish while
the CPU was pegged at 100%.

  stress -m 220 --vm-bytes 1000000000 --timeout 10

Tracing indicated a pattern as follows

          stress-3923  [007]   519.106208: mm_compaction_isolate_migratepages: range=(0x70bb80 ~ 0x70bb80) nr_scanned=0 nr_taken=0

Note that compaction is entered in rapid succession while scanning and
isolating nothing.  The problem is that when a task that is compacting
receives a fatal signal, it retries indefinitely instead of exiting
while making no progress as a fatal signal is pending.

It's not easy to trigger this condition although enabling zswap helps on
the basis that the timing is altered.  A very small window has to be hit
for the problem to occur (signal delivered while compacting and
isolating a PFN for migration that is not aligned to SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX).

This was reproduced locally -- 16G single socket system, 8G swap, 30%
zswap configured, vm-bytes 22000000000 using Colin Kings stress-ng
implementation from github running in a loop until the problem hits).
Tracing recorded the problem occurring almost 200K times in a short
window.  With this patch, the problem hit 4 times but the task existed
normally instead of consuming CPU.

This problem has existed for some time but it was made worse by commit
cf66f0700c8f ("mm, compaction: do not consider a need to reschedule as
contention").  Before that commit, if the same condition was hit then
locks would be quickly contended and compaction would exit that way.
