Rather than walking over the same pages again and again to get to the
pages that have yet to be reported we can save ourselves a significant
amount of time by simply rotating the list so that when we have a full
list of reported pages the head of the list is pointing to the next
non-reported page.  Doing this should save us some significant time when
processing each free list.

This doesn't gain us much in the standard case as all of the non-reported
pages should be near the top of the list already.  However in the case of
page shuffling this results in a noticeable improvement.  Below are the
will-it-scale page_fault1 w/ THP numbers for 16 tasks with and without
this patch.
