Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/7cdfa442.failed

Fix an overput in which filename_lookup() unconditionally drops a ref to
the filename it was given, but this isn't taken account of in the caller,
fs_lookup_param().
