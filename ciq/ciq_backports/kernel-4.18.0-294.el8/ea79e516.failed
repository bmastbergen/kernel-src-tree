Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

This script copies headers by the cpio command twice; first from
srctree, and then from objtree. However, when we building in-tree,
we know the srctree and the objtree are the same. That is, all the
headers copied by the first cpio are overwritten by the second one.

Skip the first cpio when we are building in-tree.
