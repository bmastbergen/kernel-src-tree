Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/cb1ad3ec.failed

Handle #VC exceptions caused by #DB exceptions in the guest. Those
must be handled outside of instrumentation_begin()/end() so that the
handler will not be raised recursively.

Handle them by calling the kernel's debug exception handler.
