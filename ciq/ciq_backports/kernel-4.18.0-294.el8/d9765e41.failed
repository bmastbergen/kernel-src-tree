Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/d9765e41.failed

There is no guarantee to CMA's placement, so allocating a zone specific
atomic pool from CMA might return memory from a completely different
memory zone. So stop using it.
