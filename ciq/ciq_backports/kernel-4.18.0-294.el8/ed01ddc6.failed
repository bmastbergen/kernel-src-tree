Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-294.el8/ed01ddc6.failed

The build fails with "implicit declaration of function
'acpi_device_uid'" error. Thus, protect ACPI function calls
from being called when CONFIG_ACPI is disabled.
