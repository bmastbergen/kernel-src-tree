Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/a1eb03f5.failed

The reason we defer kfree until release function is because it's a
general rule for kobjects: kfree of the reference counter itself is only
legal in the release function.

Previous patch didn't make this clear, document this in code.
