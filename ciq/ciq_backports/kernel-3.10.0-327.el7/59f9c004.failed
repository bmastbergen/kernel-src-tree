Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/59f9c004.failed

For some reason, the older commit:

    965c8e5 lseek: the "whence" argument is called "whence"

    lseek: the "whence" argument is called "whence"

    But the kernel decided to call it "origin" instead.
    Fix most of the sites.

left out xfs.  So fix xfs.
