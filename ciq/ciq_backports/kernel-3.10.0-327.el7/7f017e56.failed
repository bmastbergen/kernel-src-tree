Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/7f017e56.failed

If you do radeon.mst=1 on a gpu without mst hw, and then
plug some mst hw it will oops instead of falling back.

So check we have DCE5 at least before proceeding.
