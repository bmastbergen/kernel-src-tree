FAULT_FOLL_ALLOW_RETRY allows the page fault to drop the mmap_sem for
reading to reduce the mmap_sem contention (for writing), like while
waiting for I/O completion.  The problem is that right now practically no
get_user_pages call uses FAULT_FOLL_ALLOW_RETRY, so we're not leveraging
that nifty feature.

Andres fixed it for the KVM page fault.  However get_user_pages_fast
remains uncovered, and 99% of other get_user_pages aren't using it either
(the only exception being FOLL_NOWAIT in KVM which is really nonblocking
and in fact it doesn't even release the mmap_sem).

So this patchsets extends the optimization Andres did in the KVM page
fault to the whole kernel.  It makes most important places (including
gup_fast) to use FAULT_FOLL_ALLOW_RETRY to reduce the mmap_sem hold times
during I/O.

The only few places that remains uncovered are drivers like v4l and other
exceptions that tends to work on their own memory and they're not working
on random user memory (for example like O_DIRECT that uses gup_fast and is
fully covered by this patch).

A follow up patch should probably also add a printk_once warning to
get_user_pages that should go obsolete and be phased out eventually.  The
"vmas" parameter of get_user_pages makes it fundamentally incompatible
with FAULT_FOLL_ALLOW_RETRY (vmas array becomes meaningless the moment the
mmap_sem is released).

While this is just an optimization, this becomes an absolute requirement
for the userfaultfd feature http://lwn.net/Articles/615086/ .

The userfaultfd allows to block the page fault, and in order to do so I
need to drop the mmap_sem first.  So this patch also ensures that all
memory where userfaultfd could be registered by KVM, the very first fault
(no matter if it is a regular page fault, or a get_user_pages) always has
FAULT_FOLL_ALLOW_RETRY set.  Then the userfaultfd blocks and it is waken
only when the pagetable is already mapped.  The second fault attempt after
the wakeup doesn't need FAULT_FOLL_ALLOW_RETRY, so it's ok to retry
without it.

This patch (of 5):

We can leverage the VM_FAULT_RETRY functionality in the page fault paths
better by using either get_user_pages_locked or get_user_pages_unlocked.

The former allows conversion of get_user_pages invocations that will have
to pass a "&locked" parameter to know if the mmap_sem was dropped during
the call.  Example from:

    down_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
    do_something()
    get_user_pages(tsk, mm, ..., pages, NULL);
    up_read(&mm->mmap_sem);

to:

    int locked = 1;
    down_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
    do_something()
    get_user_pages_locked(tsk, mm, ..., pages, &locked);
    if (locked)
        up_read(&mm->mmap_sem);

The latter is suitable only as a drop in replacement of the form:

    down_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
    get_user_pages(tsk, mm, ..., pages, NULL);
    up_read(&mm->mmap_sem);

into:

    get_user_pages_unlocked(tsk, mm, ..., pages);

Where tsk, mm, the intermediate "..." paramters and "pages" can be any
value as before.  Just the last parameter of get_user_pages (vmas) must be
NULL for get_user_pages_locked|unlocked to be usable (the latter original
form wouldn't have been safe anyway if vmas wasn't null, for the former we
just make it explicit by dropping the parameter).

If vmas is not NULL these two methods cannot be used.
