Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/1891172a.failed

There is no need for users of the timecounter/cyclecounter code to include
clocksource.h just for a single macro.
