Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/3909213c.failed

We don't know the # of VQs that drivers are going to use so it's hard to
predict how much memory we'll need to map. However, the relevant
capability does give us an upper limit.
If that's below a page, we can reduce the number of required
mappings by mapping it all once ahead of the time.
