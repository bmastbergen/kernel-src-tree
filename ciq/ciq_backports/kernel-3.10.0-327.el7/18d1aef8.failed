++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +Other NFSv4.1 features, Parallel NFS operations in particular,
 +are still under development out of tree.
 +See http://wiki.linux-nfs.org/wiki/index.php/PNFS_prototype_design
 +for more information.
 +
 +The current implementation is intended for developers only: while it
 +does support ordinary file operations on clients we have tested against
 +(including the linux client), it is incomplete in ways which may limit
 +features unexpectedly, cause known bugs in rare cases, or cause
 +interoperability problems with future clients.  Known issues:
 +
 +	- gss support is questionable: currently mounts with kerberos
 +	  from a linux client are possible, but we aren't really
 +	  conformant with the spec (for example, we don't use kerberos
 +	  on the backchannel correctly).
 +	- We do not support SSV, which provides security for shared
 +	  client-server state (thus preventing unauthorized tampering
 +	  with locks and opens, for example).  It is mandatory for
 +	  servers to support this, though no clients use it yet.
 +
 +In addition, some limitations are inherited from the current NFSv4
 +implementation:
 +
 +	- Incomplete delegation enforcement: if a file is renamed or
 +	  unlinked by a local process, a client holding a delegation may
 +	  continue to indefinitely allow opens of the file under the old
 +	  name.
