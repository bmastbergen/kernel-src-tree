Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/10770bc2.failed

Minor adjustments for merge commit 53fda7f7f9e (Merge branch 'xmit_list')
that allows us to work with a list of SKBs.

Update code doc to function sch_direct_xmit().

In handle_dev_cpu_collision() use kfree_skb_list() in error handling.
