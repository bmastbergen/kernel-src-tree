Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

There were several reports that on some systems writing the SBOX0 PMU
initialization MSR would #GP at boot. This did not happen on all
systems -- my two test systems booted fine.

Writing the three initialization bits bit-by-bit seems to avoid the
problem. So add a special callback to do just that.

This replaces an earlier patch that disabled the SBOX.
