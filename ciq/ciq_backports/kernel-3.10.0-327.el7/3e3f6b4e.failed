Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/3e3f6b4e.failed

The kbuild test robot complained that we got the printk format wrong.
Let's just kill these printks instead of fixing them as there is not
point after the initial tree algorithm debugging.
