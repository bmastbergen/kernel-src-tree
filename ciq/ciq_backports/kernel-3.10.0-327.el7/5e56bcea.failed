Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/5e56bcea.failed

Codecs may have own vendor-specific verbs, and we need to allow each
driver to give such verbs for cached accesses.  Here a verb can be put
into a single array and looked through it at readable and writeable
callbacks.
