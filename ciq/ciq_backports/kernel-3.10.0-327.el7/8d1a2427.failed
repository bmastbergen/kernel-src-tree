Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/8d1a2427.failed

If uprobes are single stepped for example with gdb, the behavior should
now be correct. Before this patch, when gdb was single stepping a uprobe,
the result was a SIGILL.
When PER is active for any storage alteration and a uprobe is hit, a storage
alteration event is indicated. These over indications are filterd out by gdb,
if no change has happened within the observed area.
