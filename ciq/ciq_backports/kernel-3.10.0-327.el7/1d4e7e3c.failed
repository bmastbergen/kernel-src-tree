Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/1d4e7e3c.failed

With the 3 private slots, this gives us 512 slots total.
Motivation for this is in addition to assigned devices
support more memory hotplug slots, where 1 slot is
used by a hotplugged memory stick.
It will allow to support upto 256 hotplug memory
slots and leave 253 slots for assigned devices and
other devices that use them.
