Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/ecefde62.failed

The perf_time_to_tsc and tsc_to_perf_time functions are only used for x86.

Make inclusion of tsc.c dependent on x86 as well.
