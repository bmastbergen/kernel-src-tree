Some PTP Hardware Clock drivers use a struct timecounter to represent
their clock. To adjust the time by a given offset, these drivers all
perform a two step read/write of their timecounter. However, it is
better and simpler just to adjust the offset in one step. This patch
introduces a little routine to help drivers implement the adjtime
method.
