Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/9d82f927.failed

HD-audio doesn't support the bulk access.  Currently it works even
without this flag as implicitly assumed, but it's safer to set
explicitly.
