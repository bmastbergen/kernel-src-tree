Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/b3b8df97.failed

Some systems have been reported to have trouble with interrupts. Use
wait_event_timeout() instead of wait_event() so we don't get stuck in
that case, and log the problem.
