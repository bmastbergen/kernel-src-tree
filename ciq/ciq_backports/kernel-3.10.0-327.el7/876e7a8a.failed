Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/876e7a8a.failed

The F11 data in the HID report contains four bits of data for w_x and the least significant bits
of x. Currently only the first three bits are being used which is resulting in small jumps in
the position data on the x axis and in the w_x data.
