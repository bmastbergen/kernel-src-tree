Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/e4200f8e.failed

Currently cmd->allowed is initialized from rq->retries for discard
commands, but retries is always 0 for non-BLOCK_PC requests.  Set it
to the standard number of retries instead.
