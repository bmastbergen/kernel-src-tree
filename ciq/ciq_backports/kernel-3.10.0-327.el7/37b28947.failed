Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/37b28947.failed

There is really no need to page align sha1_transform_avx2. The default
alignment is just fine. This is not the hot code but only the entry
point, after all.
