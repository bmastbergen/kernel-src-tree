Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/d6ca69d8.failed

Move the check of multi configurations before snd_card_new() as a
short path, and reduce superfluous pointer references.
