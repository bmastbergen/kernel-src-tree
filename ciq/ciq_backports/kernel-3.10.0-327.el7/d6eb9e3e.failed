Some HD-A codecs may add their own vendor 'set' verb to the regmap, thru func
snd_hdac_add_vendor_verb(). This patch sets the GET bit (bit 11)  when adding
the verb so that its peer vendor 'get' verb is actually added. This can avoid
I/O error when writing the 'set' verb thru remap, since HD-A regmap internally
looks up a writable vendor verb with GET bit set at first.
