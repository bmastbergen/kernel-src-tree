The current documentation is incomplete wrt the intel_pstate legacy
internal governors.  The confusion comes from the general cpufreq
governors which also use the names performance and powersave.  This patch
better differentiates between the two sets of governors and gives an
explanation of how the internal P-state governors behave differently from
one another.

Also fix two minor typos.

 cpu frequency scaling algorithms only offer the CPU to be set to one
 frequency. In order to offer dynamic frequency scaling, the cpufreq
 core must be able to tell these drivers of a "target frequency". So
