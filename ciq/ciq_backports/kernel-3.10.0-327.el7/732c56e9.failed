Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/732c56e9.failed

Negotiate full 64 bit features.
Change u32 to u64, make sure to use 1ULL everywhere.

Note: devices guarantee that VERSION_1 is clear unless
revision 1 is negotiated.

Note: We don't need to re-setup the ccw, but we do it
for clarity.

Based on patches by Rusty, Thomas Huth and Cornelia.
