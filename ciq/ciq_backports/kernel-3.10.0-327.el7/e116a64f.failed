Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/e116a64f.failed

Some of the device files are required to be user accessible for PSM while
most should remain accessible only by root.

Add a parameter to hfi1_cdev_init which controls if the user should have access
to this device which places it in a different class with the appropriate
devnode callback.

In addition set the devnode call back for the existing class to be a bit more
explicit for those permissions.

Finally remove the unnecessary null check before class_destroy
