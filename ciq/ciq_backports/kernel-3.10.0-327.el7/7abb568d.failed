Since PCI is little endian, 8-bit access might work, but the spec section
is very clear on this:

  4.1.3.1 Driver Requirements: PCI Device Layout

  The driver MUST access each field using the “natural” access method,
  i.e. 32-bit accesses for 32-bit fields, 16-bit accesses for 16-bit
  fields and 8-bit accesses for 8-bit fields.
