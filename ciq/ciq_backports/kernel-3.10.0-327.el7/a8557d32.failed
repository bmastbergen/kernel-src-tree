Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/a8557d32.failed

As Rusty noted, we were accessing queue_enable with an incorrect width.
Switch to type-safe accessors so we don't make this mistake again in the
future.
