Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/c1ae6e9b.failed

The cmpxchg() was just to ensure the debug check didn't race, which was
a bit excessive. The caller is supposed to do the appropriate
synchronization, which means percpu_ref_kill() can just do a simple
store.
