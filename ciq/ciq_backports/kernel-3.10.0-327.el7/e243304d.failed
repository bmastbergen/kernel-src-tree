Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/e243304d.failed

Use orderly_reboot so userspace will to shut itself down via the reboot
path.  This is required for graceful reboot initiated by the BMC, such as
when a user uses ipmitool to issue a 'chassis power cycle' command.
