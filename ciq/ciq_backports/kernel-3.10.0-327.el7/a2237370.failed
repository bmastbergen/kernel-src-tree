Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/a2237370.failed

percpu_ref is gonna go through restructuring.  Move
percpu_ref_reinit() after percpu_ref_kill_and_confirm().  This will
make later changes easier to follow and result in cleaner
organization.
