Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/ac899061.failed

* s/percpu_ref_release/percpu_ref_func_t/ as it's customary to have _t
  postfix for types and the type is gonna be used for a different type
  of callback too.

* Add @ARG to function comments.

* Drop unnecessary and unaligned indentation from percpu_ref_init()
  function comment.
