Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/0681a282.failed

After the option conversion downdelay and updelay divide a u64
and on a 32 bit this causes the following errors:
ERROR: "__udivdi3" [drivers/net/bonding/bonding.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "__umoddi3" [drivers/net/bonding/bonding.ko] undefined!

Fix it by using a normal int instead because newval->value is capped
at INT_MAX by the way the option is defined.
