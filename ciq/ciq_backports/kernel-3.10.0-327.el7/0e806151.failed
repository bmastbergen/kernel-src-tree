Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/0e806151.failed

The firmware version is a single byte so have the variable type agree.
Since the address to this member is passed to the read function, using
an int is not even portable.
