Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/dcce5837.failed

A firmware bug is present on the XPS Haswell edition which silently
split the request in two responses when the caller ask for a read of
more than 16 bytes.
The FW sends the first 16 then the 4 next, but it says that it answered
the 20 bytes in the first report.

This occurs only on the retrieving of the min/max of X and Y of the F11
function.
We only use the first 10 bytes of the Ctrl register, so we can get only
those 10 bytes to prevent the bug from happening.
