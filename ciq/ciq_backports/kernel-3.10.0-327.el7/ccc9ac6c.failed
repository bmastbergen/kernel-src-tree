Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/ccc9ac6c.failed

It simplifies the create_hwmon_attr_name() routine and it clearly isolates
the conversion done between the OPAL node names and hwmon attributes names.
