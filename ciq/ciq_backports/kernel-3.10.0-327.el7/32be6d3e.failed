Move the contents of the include/linux/nx842.h header file into the
drivers/crypto/nx/nx-842.h header file.  Remove the nx842.h header
file and its entry in the MAINTAINERS file.

The include/linux/nx842.h header originally was there because the
crypto/842.c driver needed it to communicate with the nx-842 hw
driver.  However, that crypto compression driver was moved into
the drivers/crypto/nx/ directory, and now can directly include the
nx-842.h header.  Nothing else needs the public include/linux/nx842.h
header file, as all use of the nx-842 hardware driver will be through
the "842-nx" crypto compression driver, since the direct nx-842 api is
very limited in the buffer alignments and sizes that it will accept,
and the crypto compression interface handles those limitations and
allows any alignment and size buffers.
