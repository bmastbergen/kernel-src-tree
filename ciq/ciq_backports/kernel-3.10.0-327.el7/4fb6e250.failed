Implement percpu_ref_tryget() which fails if the refcnt already
reached zero.  Note that this is different from the recently renamed
percpu_ref_tryget_live() which fails if the refcnt has been killed and
is draining the remaining references.  percpu_ref_tryget() succeeds on
a killed refcnt as long as its current refcnt is above zero.
