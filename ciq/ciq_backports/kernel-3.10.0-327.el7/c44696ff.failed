Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/c44696ff.failed

Currently set to "6", but the reset of the code will dynamically
allocate as needed.  We need to go to "8" today, but drop the check
completely to save doing this again when we need even larger numbers.
