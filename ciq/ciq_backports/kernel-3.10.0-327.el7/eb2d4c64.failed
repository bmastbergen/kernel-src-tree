Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/eb2d4c64.failed

drivers/net/bonding/bond_options.c includes rwlock.h directly,
which is a nono, and which also breaks RT kernel build.
