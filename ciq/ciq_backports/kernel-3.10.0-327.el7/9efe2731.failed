Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The hdac regmap code checks whether the codec is powered on while
accessing, but there must be an exception -- the verbs to control the
power state.

Currently HD-audio driver doesn't access them via regmap, so this
patch doesn't fix any current behavior, but it's just for future.
