Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/86f6501b.failed

This will be used by hda controller driver to
setup stream params in prepare. This function will
setup the bdl and periods.
