Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/220d4ac7.failed

In function pie_calculate_probability(), the variables alpha and
beta are of type u64. The variables qdelay, qdelay_old and
params->target are of type psched_time_t (which is also u64).
The explicit type casting done when calculating the value for
the variable delta is redundant and not required.
