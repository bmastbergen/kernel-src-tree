Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/b89f991a.failed

Well, this is embarrassing, if the device is stopped at the end of probe,
we get into big trouble.

This was a leftover of an attempt to be smart when sending the patch,
I deeply apologies.
