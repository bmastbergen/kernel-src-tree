The two fundamental things I know we can not allow are:
- A shared signal queue aka CLONE_THREAD.  Because we compute the pid
  and uid of the signal when we place it in the queue.

- Changing the pid and by extention pid_namespace of an existing
  process.

From a parents perspective there is nothing special about the pid
namespace, to deny CLONE_PARENT, because the parent simply won't know or
care.

From the childs perspective all that is special really are shared signal
queues.

User mode threading with CLONE_PARENT|CLONE_VM|CLONE_SIGHAND and tasks
in different pid namespaces is almost certainly going to break because
it is complicated.  But shared signal handlers can look at per thread
information to know which pid namespace a process is in, so I don't know
of any reason not to support CLONE_PARENT|CLONE_VM|CLONE_SIGHAND threads
at the kernel level.  It would be absolutely stupid to implement but
that is a different thing.

So hmm.

Because it can do no harm, and because it is a regression let's remove
the CLONE_PARENT check and send it stable.
