Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/d630dc4c.failed

percpu-refcount currently reserves two lowest bits of its percpu
pointer to indicate its state; however, only one bit is used for
PCPU_REF_DEAD.

Simplify it by removing PCPU_STATUS_BITS/MASK and testing
PCPU_REF_DEAD directly.  This also allows the compiler to choose a
more efficient instruction depending on the architecture.
