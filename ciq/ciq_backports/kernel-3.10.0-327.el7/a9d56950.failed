commit a9d56950f763fa3e9d831541e62d223197d2ff60
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/a9d56950.failed

Both the last two cases are only relevant if something has failed and
something needs to be written (but not over-written), and if it is OK
to pre-read blocks at this point.  So factor out those tests and
explain them.
