commit 7afcaec4969652e177cf0b247a1530ac927a20f8
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/7afcaec4.failed

Otherwise the name of the kobject isn't getting freed and other stuff from
kobject_cleanup() isn't getting called. kobject_put() will call
kobject_del() on its own in kobject_cleanup().
