Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/f9f54f16.failed

It simplifies the creation of the hwmon attributes and will help when
support for a new device tree layout is added. The patch also changes
the name of the routine to parse_opal_node_name().
