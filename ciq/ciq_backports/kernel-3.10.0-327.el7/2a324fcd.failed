Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/2a324fcd.failed

It's utterly unsafe to proceed further the disconnect procedure if the
assigned usbdev is inconsistent with the expected object.  Better to
put a WARN_ON() for more cautions and abort immediately.
