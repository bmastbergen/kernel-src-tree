Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/f2bd242f.failed

It is unlikely this function would ever be used in a context without a
pointer to a `struct usb_line6_toneport', so grab the device type from
it rather than having the caller do it.
