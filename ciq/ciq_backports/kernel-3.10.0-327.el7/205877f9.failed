Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/205877f9.failed

Only a handful of machines have this enabled by default, where it's been
proven to work.  The workaround can be explicitly enabled with a module
option also.

Still waiting on feedback from NVIDIA for a proper idea of exactly what
this fix is doing, and how to implement it properly.
