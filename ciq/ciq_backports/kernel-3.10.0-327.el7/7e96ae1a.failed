The IvyBridge-EP uncore driver was missing three filter flags:
NC, ISOC, C6 which are useful in some cases. Support them in the same way
as the Haswell EP driver, by allowing to set them and exposing
them in the sysfs formats.

Also fix a typo in a define.

Relies on the Haswell EP driver to be applied earlier.
