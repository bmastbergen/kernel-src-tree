commit f3dfd1be08cc55f930f32e714fb1967630c47991
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/f3dfd1be.failed

Put an upper bound on how long we will wait for the device to respond to
a read/write request (i.e., 100 milliseconds) and return an error if
this is reached.
