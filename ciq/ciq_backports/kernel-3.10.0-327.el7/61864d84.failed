commit 61864d844c296933d40c02683252bbea5193b101
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/61864d84.failed

Promote line6 driver from staging to sound/usb/line6 directory, and
maintain through sound subsystem tree.

This commit just moves the code and adapts Makefile / Kconfig.
The further renames and misc cleanups will follow.
