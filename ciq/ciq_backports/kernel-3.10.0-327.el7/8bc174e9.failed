Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/8bc174e9.failed

Although they can be written, handle a few verbs as read-only in
regmap interface: CONFIG_DEFAULT, CONV and CVT_CHAN_COUNT.  These are
either updated in PCM or HDMI management code in a volatile manner, or
just needed only as parameter, thus they don't need to be written at
resume sync.
