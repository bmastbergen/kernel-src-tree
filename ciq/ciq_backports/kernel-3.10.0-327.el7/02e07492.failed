Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Post-2013 Lenovo laptops provide correct min/max dimensions, which are
different with the ones currently quirked.  According to
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91541 the following board ids
are assigned in the post-2013 touchpads:

t440p/t440s: LEN0036 -> 2964/2962
t540p:       LEN0034 -> 2964

Using 2961 as the common minimum makes these 3 laptops OK. We may need
to update those values later if other pnp_ids has a lower board_id.
