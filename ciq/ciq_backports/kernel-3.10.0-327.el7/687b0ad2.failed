Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-327.el7/687b0ad2.failed

AIO had a missing get, which led to an ioctx leak - after percpu_ref_kill() the
ref was 0 so percpu_ref_put() never saw it hit 0.

This wasn't noticed at the time because it all happened completely silently,
this adds a WARN() which would've caught the aio bug.

tj: Used WARN_ONCE() instead of WARN().
