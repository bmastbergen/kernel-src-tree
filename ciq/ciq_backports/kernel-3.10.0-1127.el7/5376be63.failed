Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/5376be63.failed

Output subdevices that rely on other output subdevices (or otherwise
don't directly talk to an output port on the switch) don't need to be
assigned an output port either.
