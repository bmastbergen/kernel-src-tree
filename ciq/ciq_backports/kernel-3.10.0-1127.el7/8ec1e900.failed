Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/8ec1e900.failed

Variables allocated by kvzalloc should not be freed by kfree.
Because they may be allocated by vmalloc.
So we replace kfree with kvfree here.
