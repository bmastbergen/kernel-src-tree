Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/800fb34a.failed

When computing the limit of time to spend in the loop in poll_idle(),
use the target residency of the first enabled idle state deeper than
state 0 instead of always using the target residency of state 1.

This helps when state 1 is disabled for diagnostics, for instance.
