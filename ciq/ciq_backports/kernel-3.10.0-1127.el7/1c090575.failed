Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/1c090575.failed

STM policy handling is basically configfs, I honestly don't know how we
ended up without a Kconfig dependency, but thanks to randconfig testing,
it's now caught.
