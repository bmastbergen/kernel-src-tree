Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/fb080190.failed

Readability: a postfix increment is used on a pointer which is not
used anywhere afterwards, which may send the reader looking through
the function one extra time. Drop the unnecessary increment.
