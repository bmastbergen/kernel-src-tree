Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/73061da0.failed

devm_ioremap() returns NULL on error, it doesn't return an ERR_PTR,
which is what the current code does. This patch corrects these
checks.
