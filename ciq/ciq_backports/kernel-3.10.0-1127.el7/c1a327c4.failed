Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

There's a commented-out function in the GTH driver that's a leftover
from previous versions of the driver, where we tried to inherit the
pre-existing configuration, which didn't prove to be a sound idea.

This patch removes the function. No functional changes.
