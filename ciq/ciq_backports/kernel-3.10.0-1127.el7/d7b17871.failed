Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/d7b17871.failed

Already during the subdevice initialization time, devices will need
to reference Intel TH controller descriptor structure.

This patch moves setting the drvdata from the pci glue to intel_th
core, before subdevices are populated.
