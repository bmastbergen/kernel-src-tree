Currently, an Intel TH (pci) device will be always active, because the
devices on the 'intel_th' bus don't implement runtime pm to track their
usage.

To address this, this patch adds runtime pm support to the 'intel_th'
bus and some additional bits for the hub. The 'output' type device is
in use while a capture is active; the 'source' type device (STH) relies
on its child stm class device for runtime pm tracking.
