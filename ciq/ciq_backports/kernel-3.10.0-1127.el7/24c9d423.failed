It was previously noted that Kconfig complained about unmet dependencies
when trying to configure skx_edac together with CONFIG_ACPI=n. First fix
for this checked for ACPI when doing

  select ACPI_ADXL

but this required stub functions for the case where ACPI wasn't
selected. It also allowed building a driver that didn't actually work
for a system that has non-volatile DIMMs.

Arnd Bergmann pointed out that the right fix is to make EDAC_SKX
"depend on ACPI".
