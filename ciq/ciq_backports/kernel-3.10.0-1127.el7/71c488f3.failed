Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/71c488f3.failed

The "size" variable comes from the user so we need to verify that it's
large enough to hold an stp_policy_id struct.
