Right now, if stm device removal has to unbind from a policy (that is,
an stm device that has STP policy, gets removed), it will trigger a
nested lock on the stm device's policy mutex.

This patch fixes the problem by moving the locking from the policy
unbinding to policy removal (configfs path), where it's actually needed;
the other caller of the policy unbinding function already takes the
mutex around the call.
