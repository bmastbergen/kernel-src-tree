Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/f3587d76.failed

If the kernel allocates a bounce buffer for user read data, this memory
needs to be cleared before copying it to the user, otherwise it may leak
kernel memory to user space.
