Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/c8be4899.failed

Changing nr_devs after the module has been loaded doesn't actually
change anything, so just make it read-only.
