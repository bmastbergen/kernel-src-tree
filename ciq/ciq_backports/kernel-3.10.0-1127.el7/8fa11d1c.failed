Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/8fa11d1c.failed

No point in explicitly setting something to zero right after we
explicitly checked that it is zero. Fix this.
