Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/f45f40ad.failed

The return type "unsigned int" was used by the stm_find_master_chan function
despite of the aspect that it will eventually return a negative error code.

Done with the help of Coccinelle.
