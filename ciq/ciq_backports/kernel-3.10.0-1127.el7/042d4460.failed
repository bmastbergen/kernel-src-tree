The newly added STM code uses SRCU, but does not ensure that
this code is part of the kernel:

drivers/built-in.o: In function `stm_source_link_show':
include/linux/srcu.h:221: undefined reference to `__srcu_read_lock'
include/linux/srcu.h:238: undefined reference to `__srcu_read_unlock'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `stm_source_link_drop':
include/linux/srcu.h:221: undefined reference to `__srcu_read_lock'
include/linux/srcu.h:238: undefined reference to `__srcu_read_unlock'

This adds a Kconfig 'select' statement like all the other SRCU using
drivers have.
