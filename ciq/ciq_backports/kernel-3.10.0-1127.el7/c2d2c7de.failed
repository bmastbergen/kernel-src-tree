Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/c2d2c7de.failed

When the Trace Hub is operating in Host Debugger mode, it is up to the
debugger to configure master routing even for the software sources. Do
not do this in the driver in this case.
