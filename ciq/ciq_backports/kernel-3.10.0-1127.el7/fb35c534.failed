Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/fb35c534.failed

New channels are applied to the priv channels only after they
are successfully opened. Then, the indirection table should be built
according to the new number of channels.
Currently, such build is preformed independently of whether the
channels opening is successful, and is not reverted on failure.

The bug is caused due to removal of rss params from channels struct
and moving it to priv struct. That change cause to independency between
channels and rss params.
This causes a crash on a later point, when accessing rqn of a non
existing channel.

This patch fixes it by moving the indirection table build right before
switching the priv channels to new channels struct, after the new set of
channels was successfully opened.
