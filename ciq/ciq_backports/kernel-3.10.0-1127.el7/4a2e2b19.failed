Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/4a2e2b19.failed

If STM=n, it doesn't make sense to ask about STM_DUMMY and
STM_SOURCE_CONSOLE support, which are not even built when enabled
anyway. Hence hide these options if STM=n.
