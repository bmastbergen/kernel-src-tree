Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/8e9a2beb.failed

Right now it's possible to unload the msu driver while its character
device is open. Prevent it by setting fops::owner, which will result
in the module reference being held while the device node is open.
