Some STM devices adjust software assigned master numbers depending on
the trace source and its runtime state and whatnot. This patch adds
a sysfs attribute to inform the trace-side software that master numbers
assigned to software sources will not match those in the STP stream,
so that, for example, master/channel allocation policy can be adjusted
accordingly.
