Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/7531a359.failed

Platforms which are not affected by X86_BUG_TAA may want the TSX feature
enabled. Add "auto" option to the TSX cmdline parameter. When tsx=auto
disable TSX when X86_BUG_TAA is present, otherwise enable TSX.

More details on X86_BUG_TAA can be found here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.html

 [ bp: Extend the arg buffer to accommodate "auto\0". ]

+ 			This parameter controls the TSX feature. The options are:
+ 
+ 			on	- Enable TSX on the system. Although there are
+ 				mitigations for all known security vulnerabilities,
+ 				TSX has been known to be an accelerator for
+ 				several previous speculation-related CVEs, and
+ 				so there may be unknown	security risks associated
+ 				with leaving it enabled.
+ 
+ 			off	- Disable TSX on the system. (Note that this
+ 				option takes effect only on newer CPUs which are
+ 				not vulnerable to MDS, i.e., have
+ 				MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.MDS_NO=1 and which get
+ 				the new IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR through a microcode
+ 				update. This new MSR allows for the reliable
+ 				deactivation of the TSX functionality.)
+ 
+ 			auto	- Disable TSX if X86_BUG_TAA is present,
+ 				  otherwise enable TSX on the system.
+ 
+ 			Not specifying this option is equivalent to tsx=off.
+ 
+ 			See Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.rst
+ 			for more details.
