Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/b07a5c53.failed

If X86_FEATURE_RTM is disabled, the guest should not be able to access
MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL.  We can therefore use it in KVM to force all
transactions from the guest to abort.
