Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/f152dfee.failed

Do release the resources when msu subdevice gets removed: stop the
capture if it is active (which is still possible even though the
module in pinned) and free the capture buffers.
