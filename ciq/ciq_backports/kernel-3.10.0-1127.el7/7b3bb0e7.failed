Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/7b3bb0e7.failed

Since both sw_start and sw_end are master indices, the size of array
that holds them is sw_end - sw_start + 1, which the current code gets
wrong, allocating one item less than required.

This patch corrects the allocation size, avoiding potential slab
corruption.
