Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Currently the check to see if a page is allocated is incorrect
and is checking if the pointer page is null, not *page as
intended.  Fix this.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference before null check")
Fixes: f5cedc84a30d ("gve: Add transmit and receive support")
