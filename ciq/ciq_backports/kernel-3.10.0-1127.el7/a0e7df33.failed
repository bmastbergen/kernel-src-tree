Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/a0e7df33.failed

On some devices (TH 2.x devices at the moment), the internal time counter
is initially not synchronized to the global crystal clock, so the time
stamps it produces will not be useful. In this case, the driver needs
to force the time counter resync.

This applies the workaround to relevant devices.
