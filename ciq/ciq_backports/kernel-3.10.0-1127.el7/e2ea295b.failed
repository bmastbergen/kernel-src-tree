Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/e2ea295b.failed

Right now it's possible to unload the output subdevice's driver while
the capture to this output is active. Prevent this by holding the
output driver's module reference.
