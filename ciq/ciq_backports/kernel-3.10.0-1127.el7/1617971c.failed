Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/1617971c.failed

The default time is declared in units of microsecnds,
but is used as nanoseconds, resulting in significant
accounting errors for idle state 0 time when all idle
states deeper than 0 are disabled.

Under these unusual conditions, we don't really care
about the poll time limit anyhow.
