hugetlb pages should only be migrated if they are 'active'.  The
routines set/clear_page_huge_active() modify the active state of hugetlb
pages.

When a new hugetlb page is allocated at fault time, set_page_huge_active
is called before the page is locked.  Therefore, another thread could
race and migrate the page while it is being added to page table by the
fault code.  This race is somewhat hard to trigger, but can be seen by
strategically adding udelay to simulate worst case scheduling behavior.
Depending on 'how' the code races, various BUG()s could be triggered.

To address this issue, simply delay the set_page_huge_active call until
after the page is successfully added to the page table.

Hugetlb pages can also be leaked at migration time if the pages are
associated with a file in an explicitly mounted hugetlbfs filesystem.
For example, consider a two node system with 4GB worth of huge pages
available.  A program mmaps a 2G file in a hugetlbfs filesystem.  It
then migrates the pages associated with the file from one node to
another.  When the program exits, huge page counts are as follows:

  node0
  1024    free_hugepages
  1024    nr_hugepages

  node1
  0       free_hugepages
  1024    nr_hugepages

  Filesystem                         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  nodev                              4.0G  2.0G  2.0G  50% /var/opt/hugepool

That is as expected.  2G of huge pages are taken from the free_hugepages
counts, and 2G is the size of the file in the explicitly mounted
filesystem.  If the file is then removed, the counts become:

  node0
  1024    free_hugepages
  1024    nr_hugepages

  node1
  1024    free_hugepages
  1024    nr_hugepages

  Filesystem                         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  nodev                              4.0G  2.0G  2.0G  50% /var/opt/hugepool

Note that the filesystem still shows 2G of pages used, while there
actually are no huge pages in use.  The only way to 'fix' the filesystem
accounting is to unmount the filesystem

If a hugetlb page is associated with an explicitly mounted filesystem,
this information in contained in the page_private field.  At migration
time, this information is not preserved.  To fix, simply transfer
page_private from old to new page at migration time if necessary.

There is a related race with removing a huge page from a file and
migration.  When a huge page is removed from the pagecache, the
page_mapping() field is cleared, yet page_private remains set until the
page is actually freed by free_huge_page().  A page could be migrated
while in this state.  However, since page_mapping() is not set the
hugetlbfs specific routine to transfer page_private is not called and we
leak the page count in the filesystem.

To fix that, check for this condition before migrating a huge page.  If
the condition is detected, return EBUSY for the page.
