Currently, the list of stm_sources linked to an stm device is protected by
a spinlock, which also means that sources' .unlink() method is called under
this spinlock. However, this method may (and does) sleep, which means
trouble.

This patch slightly reworks locking around stm::link_list so that bits that
might_sleep() are called with a mutex held instead. Modification of this
list requires both mutex and spinlock to be held, while looking at the list
can be done under either mutex or spinlock.
