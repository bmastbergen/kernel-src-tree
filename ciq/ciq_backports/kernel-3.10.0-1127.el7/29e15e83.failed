Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/29e15e83.failed

A glue layer may want to install its own hooks into trace capture start
and stop paths to apply workarounds. This adds optional callbacks.
