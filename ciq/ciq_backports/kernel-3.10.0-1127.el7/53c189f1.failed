commit 53c189f1762ba392b5c24a2f06382d5eb1399c25
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/53c189f1.failed

There's a kerneldoc comment that'd been derived from another one by way
of copying-and-pasting but hadn't been subsequently amended to reflect
the purpose of the function. Fix this.
