Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/f18a9531.failed

If output subdevice driver is not loaded, activating it will try to
call its ->activate method and crash. Fix this by explicitly checking
for the driver.
