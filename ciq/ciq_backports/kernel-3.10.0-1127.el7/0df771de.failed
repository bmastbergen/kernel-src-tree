Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1127.el7/0df771de.failed

Source device's link is protected with srcu, mark it as such to have
proper build-time validation of accesses to this field. The update
side that's dereferencing it under an update lock also needs an
accessor to dereference this field to keep sparse happy.
