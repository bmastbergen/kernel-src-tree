Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/8aef7340.failed

The xdp_umem_page holds the address for a page. Trade memory for
faster lookup. Later, we'll add DMA address here as well.
