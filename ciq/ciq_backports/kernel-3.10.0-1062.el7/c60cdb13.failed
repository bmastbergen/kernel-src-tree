Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

When a switch rule is initially created we set the filter action to
ICE_FWD_TO_VSI. The filter action changes to ICE_FWD_TO_VSI_LIST
whenever more than one VSI is subscribed to the same switch rule. When
the switch rule goes from 2 VSIs in the list to 1 VSI we remove and
delete the VSI list rule, but we currently don't update the switch rule
in hardware. This is causing switch rules to be lost, so fix that by
making a call to ice_update_pkt_fwd_rule() with the necessary changes.
