Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/5df7e45d.failed

Currently, there is no bit, or set of bits, that protect the entirety
of the reset path.

If the reset is originated by the driver, then the relevant
one of the following bits will be set when the reset is scheduled:
__ICE_PFR_REQ
__ICE_CORER_REQ
__ICE_GLOBR_REQ
This bit will not be cleared until after the rebuild has completed.

If the reset is originated by the FW, then the first the driver knows of
it will be the reception of the OICR interrupt.  The __ICE_RESET_OICR_RECV
bit will be set in the interrupt handler.  This will also be the indicator
in a SW originated reset that we have completed the pre-OICR tasks and
have informed the FW that a reset was requested.

To utilize these bits, change the function:
ice_is_reset_recovery_pending()
	to be:
ice_is_reset_in_progress()

The new function will check all of the above bits in the pf->state and
will return a true if one or more of these bits are set.
