This patch includes below changes to resolve the issue of ETS bandwidth
shaping to work.

1. Allocation of Tx queues is accounted for based on the enabled TC's
   in ice_vsi_setup_q_map() and enabled the Tx queues on those TC's via
   ice_vsi_cfg_txqs()

2. Get the mapped netdev TC # for the user priority and set the priority
   to TC mapping for the VSI.
