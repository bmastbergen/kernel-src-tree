When compiling and analyzing the driver on newer kernels, a static
analyzer warns about the following "numeric overflow" issues:

  "The result of expression: 'budget-1' generates 4-byte type while casting
   to a bigger size of 8-byte".

  "The result of expression: '*words-words_read' generates 4-byte type
   while casting to a bigger size of 8-byte".

Fix them both.
