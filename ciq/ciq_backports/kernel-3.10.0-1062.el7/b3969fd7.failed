Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/b3969fd7.failed

When a malicious operation is detected, the firmware triggers an
interrupt, which is then picked up by the service task (specifically by
ice_handle_mdd_event). A reset is scheduled if required.

Tx hang detection works in a similar way, except the logic here monitors
the VSI's Tx queues and tries to revive them if stalled. If the hang is
not resolved, the kernel eventually calls ndo_tx_timeout, which is
handled by ice_tx_timeout.
