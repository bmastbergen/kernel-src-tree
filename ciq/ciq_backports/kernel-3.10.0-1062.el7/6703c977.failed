Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.

When failing on one of the BPF tests we were just stating:

  BPF filter result incorrect

Add some more info to help figuring out the problem:

 BPF filter result incorrect, expected 56, got 0 samples

This came out while investigating this failure, first seen after
updating the kernel to the 4.15.0-rc6 tag:

  [root@jouet ~]# perf test bpf
  39: BPF filter               :
  39.1: Basic BPF filtering    : FAILED!
  39.2: BPF pinning            : Skip
  39.3: BPF prologue generation: Skip
  39.4: BPF relocation checker : Skip
