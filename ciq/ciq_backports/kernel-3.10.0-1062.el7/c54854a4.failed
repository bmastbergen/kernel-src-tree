Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/c54854a4.failed

Move the tracepoint in xfs_iext_insert to after the point where we've
inserted the extent because otherwise we report stale extent data in
the ftrace output.
