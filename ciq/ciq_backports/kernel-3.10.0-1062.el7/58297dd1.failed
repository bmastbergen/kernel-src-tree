commit 58297dd133f64ea028e7d52dd00cd9ff8aa4479f
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/58297dd1.failed

According to the spec, whenever insert PVID field is set, the VLAN
driver insertion mode should be set to 01b which isn't done currently.
Fix it.
