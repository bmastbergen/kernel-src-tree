Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/35ae5414.failed

The upstream and out-of-tree drivers are once again at comparable
functionality. It's been a while since we updated the upstream driver
version, so bump it now.
