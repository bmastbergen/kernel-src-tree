Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/b9f3eb49.failed

Move inclusion of a private kernel header <net/tcp.h>
from uapi/linux/tls.h to its only user - net/tls.h,
to fix the following linux/tls.h userspace compilation error:

/usr/include/linux/tls.h:41:21: fatal error: net/tcp.h: No such file or directory

As to this point uapi/linux/tls.h was totaly unusuable for userspace,
cleanup this header file further by moving other redundant includes
to net/tls.h.
