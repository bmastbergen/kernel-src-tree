Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/7919cd82.failed

ca0132_config() was setting some values in the auto_pin_cfg for
the codec... but it is called prior to snd_hda_parse_pin_defcfg(),
which does a memset() to clear the entire structure as one of its
first actions, making the entire exercise pointless.

Kill all use of struct auto_pin_cfg from ca0132_config().
