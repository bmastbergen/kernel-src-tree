Add some hints about overlayfs kernel config options.

Enabling NFS export by default is especially recommended against, as it
incurs a performance penalty even if the filesystem is not actually
exported.

+ 	  the inodes index dir to decode overlay NFS file handles by default.
+ 	  In this case, it is still possible to turn off NFS export support
+ 	  globally with the "nfs_export=off" module option or on a filesystem
+ 	  instance basis with the "nfs_export=off" mount option.
+ 
+ 	  The NFS export feature creates an index on copy up of every file and
+ 	  directory.  This full index is used to detect overlay filesystems
+ 	  inconsistencies on lookup, like redirect from multiple upper dirs to
+ 	  the same lower dir.  The full index may incur some overhead on mount
+ 	  time, especially when verifying that directory file handles are not
+ 	  stale.

+ 
+ 	  Most users should say N here and enable this feature on a case-by-
+ 	  case basis with the "nfs_export=on" mount option.
+
