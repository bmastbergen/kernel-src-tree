Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/21d2b122.failed

If drm_gem_handle_create() fails in vgem_gem_create(), then the
drm_vgem_gem_object is freed twice: once when the reference is dropped
by drm_gem_object_put_unlocked(), and again by __vgem_gem_destroy().

This was hit by syzkaller using fault injection.

Fix it by skipping the second free.
