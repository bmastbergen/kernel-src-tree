Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/f25dad19.failed

A recent update to smatch is causing it to report the error "we previously
assumed 'm_entry->vsi_list_info' could be null". Fix that.
