Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/f6fe01b7.failed

Return the matching device EQN for a given user vector number via the
DEVX interface.

Note:
EQs are owned by the kernel and shared by all user processes.
Basically, a user CQ can point to any EQ.
The kernel doesn't enforce any such limitation today either.
