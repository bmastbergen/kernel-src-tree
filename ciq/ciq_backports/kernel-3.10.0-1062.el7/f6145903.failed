Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/f6145903.failed

Another setsockopt (XDP_TX_QUEUE) is added to let the process allocate
a queue, where the user process can pass frames to be transmitted by
the kernel.

The mmapping of the queue is done using the XDP_PGOFF_TX_QUEUE offset.
