Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/ba4a4119.failed

A user can provide a hint which will be attached to the packet and written
to the CQE on receive. This can be used as a way to offload operations
into the HW, for example parsing a packet which is a tunneled packet, and
if so, pass 0x1 as the hint. The software can use that hint to decapsulate
the packet and parse only the inner headers thus saving CPU cycles.
