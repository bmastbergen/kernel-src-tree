Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/be8ff000.failed

When adding a rule, queue region size needs to be provided as log base 2
of the number of queues in region. Fix that.
