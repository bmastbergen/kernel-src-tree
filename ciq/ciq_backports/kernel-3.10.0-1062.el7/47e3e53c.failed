Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The scheduler tree is is always rebuilt during reset. The existing code
adds new scheduler nodes for queues but may not clean up earlier nodes.
This patch removed the old scheduler tree during reset before it is
rebuilt.
