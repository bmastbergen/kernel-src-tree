Currently, switch filters get replayed after reset. In addition to
filters, other VSI attributes (like RSS configuration, Tx scheduler
configuration, etc.) also need to be replayed after reset.

Thus, instead of replaying based on functional blocks (i.e. replay
all filters for all VSIs, followed by RSS configuration replay for
all VSIs, and so on), it makes more sense to have the replay centered
around a VSI. In other words, replay all configurations for a VSI before
moving on to rebuilding the next VSI.

To that effect, this patch introduces a VSI replay framework in a new
function ice_vsi_replay_all. Currently it only replays switch filters,
but it will be expanded in the future to replay additional VSI attributes.
