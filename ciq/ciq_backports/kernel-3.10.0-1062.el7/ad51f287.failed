Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/ad51f287.failed

Reduce size of duplicated comments by switching to use SPDX identifier.

No functional change.

While here, correct MODULE_LICENSE() string to be aligned with license text.
