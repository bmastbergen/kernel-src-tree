This patch cleans up the existing register definitions.

1) Several instances of long defines names used in the BIT() macro
   were replaced to use the actual values they represent. As a
   result some defines for shifts (ending with _S) that were used
   only to create bitmasks were removed completely.

2) Apply more consistent tab spacing.
