Rebuild_History Non-Buildable kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7
commit-author Jakub Kicinski <jakub.kicinski@netronome.com>
commit 96de25060d192523fa3c75110dc6348df47fa078
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/96de2506.failed

Replace the repeated license text with SDPX identifiers.
While at it bump the Copyright dates for files we touched
this year.
