A log recovery failure has been reproduced where a symlink inode has
a zero length in extent form. It was caused by a shutdown during a
combined fstress+fsmark workload.

The underlying problem is the issue in xfs_inactive_symlink(): the
inode is unlocked between the symlink inactivation/truncation and
the inode being freed. This opens a window for the inode to be
written to disk before it xfs_ifree() removes it from the unlinked
list, marks it free in the inobt and zeros the mode.

For shortform inodes, the fix is simple. xfs_ifree() clears the data
fork state, so there's no need to do it in xfs_inactive_symlink().
This means the shortform fork verifier will not see a zero length
data fork as it mirrors the inode size through to xfs_ifree()), and
hence if the inode gets written back and the fork verifiers are run
they will still see a fork that matches the on-disk inode size.

For extent form (remote) symlinks, it is a little more tricky. Here
we explicitly set the inode size to zero, so the above race can lead
to zero length symlinks on disk. Because the inode is unlinked at
this point (i.e. on the unlinked list) and unreferenced, it can
never be seen again by a user. Hence when we set the inode size to
zeor, also change the type to S_IFREG. xfs_ifree() expects S_IFREG
inodes to be of zero length, and so this avoids all the problems of
zero length symlinks ever hitting the disk. It also avoids the
problem of needing to handle zero length symlink inodes in log
recovery to replay the extent free intents and the remaining
deferops to free the extents the symlink used.

Also add a couple of asserts to warn us if zero length symlinks end
up in either the symlink create or inactivation paths.
