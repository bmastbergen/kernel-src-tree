+ 	  If this config option is enabled then overlay filesystems will use
+ 	  the index directory to decode overlay NFS file handles by default.
+ 	  In this case, it is still possible to turn off NFS export support
+ 	  globally with the "nfs_export=off" module option or on a filesystem
+ 	  instance basis with the "nfs_export=off" mount option.
+ 
+ 	  The NFS export feature creates an index on copy up of every file and
+ 	  directory.  This full index is used to detect overlay filesystems
+ 	  inconsistencies on lookup, like redirect from multiple upper dirs to
+ 	  the same lower dir.  The full index may incur some overhead on mount
+ 	  time, especially when verifying that directory file handles are not
+ 	  stale.
+ 
+ 	  Note, that the NFS export feature is not backward compatible.
+ 	  That is, mounting an overlay which has a full index on a kernel
+ 	  that doesn't support this feature will have unexpected results.
+ 
+ 	  Most users should say N here and enable this feature on a case-by-
+ 	  case basis with the "nfs_export=on" mount option.
+ 
+ 	  Say N unless you fully understand the consequences.

+ config OVERLAY_FS_XINO_AUTO

+ 	depends on OVERLAY_FS
+ 	help
+ 	  If this config option is enabled then overlay filesystems will use
+ 	  unused high bits in undelying filesystem inode numbers to map all
+ 	  inodes to a unified address space.  The mapped 64bit inode numbers
+ 	  might not be compatible with applications that expect 32bit inodes.
+ 
+ 	  If compatibility with applications that expect 32bit inodes is not an
+ 	  issue, then it is safe and recommended to say Y here.
