Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/55aa141e.failed

Indicate these structs should not be modified and take advantage of some
compiler optimizations by making these structs const.
