Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/5ed5d316.failed

Currently ICE_MAX_MTU subtracts only ETH_HLEN from max frame size and
adds ETH_FCS_LEN and VLAN_HLEN, which is not what was intended.
The ETH_HLEN + ETH_FCS_LEN + VLAN_HLEN expression should be surrounded
with parentheses.

Wrap mentioned expression and take into account VLAN double tagging.
