Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/0f5d4c21.failed

Setting Rx or Tx pause parameter currently results in link loss on the
interface, requiring the platform/host to be cold power cycled. Fix it.
