Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/fcbd8fa4.failed

As stated in tests/llvm-src-base.c, the name of the bpf function should
be "bpf_func__SyS_epoll_pwait" but this clang test fails as it tries to
lookup "bpf_func__SyS_epoll_wait".
