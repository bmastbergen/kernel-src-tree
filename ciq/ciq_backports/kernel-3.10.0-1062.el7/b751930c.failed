Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/b751930c.failed

In ice_vsi_release we are always assigning a value to the local VF
variable. Change this to only be assigned if the VSI is a VF VSI.
