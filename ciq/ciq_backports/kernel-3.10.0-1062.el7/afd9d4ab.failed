Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/afd9d4ab.failed

The remove path does not currently check to see if a
reset is in progress before proceeding.  This can cause
a resource collision resulting in various types of errors.

Check for reset in progress and wait for a reasonable
amount of time before allowing the remove to progress.
