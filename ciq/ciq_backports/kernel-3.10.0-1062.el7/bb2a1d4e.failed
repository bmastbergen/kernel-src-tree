Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/bb2a1d4e.failed

Although it is easy to see that the code in nvme_init_subnqn() guarantees that
the subsys->nqn string is '\0'-terminated, apparently Coverity is not smart
enough to see this. Make it easier for Coverity to analyze this code by changing
the strncpy() call into a strlcpy() call. This patch does not change the
behavior of the code but fixes Coveritiy ID 1423720.
