commit 7b847f523fe07b4ad73a01cec49a4da86a9be412
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/7b847f52.failed

While at it, ensure that the location of the local save area is
consistent whether or not we setup our own stackframe. This property is
utilised in the next patch that adds support for tail calls.
