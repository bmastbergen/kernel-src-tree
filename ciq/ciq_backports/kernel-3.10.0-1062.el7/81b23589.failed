commit 81b23589f4830b672ffbad7162fc838c6791d22a
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/81b23589.failed

If the driver is unloaded when traffic is in progress, errors are
generated. Fix this by releasing qvectors and NAPI handler on remove.
