Rebuild_History Non-Buildable kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7
commit-author Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>
commit 243ac21035176ac9692c1308a9f3b8f6a4e5d733
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/243ac210.failed

And get rid of the license text that is no longer necessary.
