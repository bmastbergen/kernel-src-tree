Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/40c3c546.failed

Ethtool reported pause params based on the currently negotiated
link settings instead of current PHY config. User was not able
to turn off pause params because ethtool was incorrectly reporting
parameters as off when link was down even though PHY was configured
to support pause frames. Now pause params are taken from PHY config
instead of link status.
