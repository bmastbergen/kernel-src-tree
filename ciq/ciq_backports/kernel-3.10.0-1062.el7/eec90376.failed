If ice driver has q_vectors w/ active NAPI that has no rings,
then this will result in a divide by zero error. To correct it
I am updating the driver code so that we only support NAPI on
q_vectors that have 1 or more rings allocated to them.

See commit 13a8cd191a2b ("i40e: Do not enable NAPI on q_vectors
that have no rings") for detail.
