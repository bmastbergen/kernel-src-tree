With gcc-4.1.2 on 32-bit:

    net/xdp/xsk.c:663: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    net/xdp/xsk.c:665: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type

Add the missing "ULL" suffixes to the large XDP_UMEM_PGOFF_*_RING values
to fix this.

    net/xdp/xsk.c:663: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
    net/xdp/xsk.c:665: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type

"unsigned long" is 32-bit on 32-bit systems, hence the offset is
truncated, and can never be equal to any of the XDP_UMEM_PGOFF_*_RING
values.  Use loff_t (and the required cast) to fix this.
