Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/4a471d7c.failed

The calls of snd_info_register() are superfluous and should be avoided
at the procfs creation time.  They are called at the end of the whole
initialization via snd_card_register().  This patch drops such
superfluous calls.
