Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/7b8ff0f9.failed

With much traffic coming into the port, Rx queue disable
procedure can take more time until all pending queue
requests on PCIe finish. Reuse ICE_Q_WAIT_MAX_RETRY macro
and increase the delay itself.
