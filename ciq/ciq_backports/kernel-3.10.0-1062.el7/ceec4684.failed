Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/ceec4684.failed

sound/pci/hda/local.h seems to be an earlier version of
sound/hda/local.h; it was added at the same time but doesn't seem to
have ever been used (within the git history).  Most of its macros
depend on a hdac_read_parm() function which is not defined anywhere.
