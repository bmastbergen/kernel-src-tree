Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/e28408e9.failed

Set xon = xoff - netdev's max_mtu.
netdev's max_mtu will give enough time for the pause frame to
arrive at the sender.
