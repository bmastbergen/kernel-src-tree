Clean control queues only when they are initialized. One of the ways to
validate if the basic initialization is done is by checking value of
cq->sq.head and cq->rq.head variables that specify the register address.
This patch adds a check to avoid NULL pointer dereference crash when tried
to shutdown uninitialized control queue.
