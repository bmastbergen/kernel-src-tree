commit e3dbc6d1d470e924529adf1e3e8e8447dc9b6977
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/e3dbc6d1.failed

Cleanups, do the replacement and change the levels to the proper
ones for the function they are serving, as many were wrong.
