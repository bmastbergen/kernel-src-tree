Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/ffe49823.failed

Since the req_speeds field in struct ice_link_status is a u8,
req_speeds & ICE_AQ_LINK_SPEED_40GB always returns 0. This was caught
by a coverity scan.

Fix this by changing req_speeds to be u16.
