Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/dab0588f.failed

In ice_vsi_setup_[tx|rx]_rings, err is uninitialized which can result in
a garbage value return to the caller. Fix that.
