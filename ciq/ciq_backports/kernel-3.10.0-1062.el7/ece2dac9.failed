Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/ece2dac9.failed

While we have no users yet rename the platform driver to use the same
pattern as the rest of Intel SoCs, i.e. use full SoC name in
'apollolake-pinctrl'.
