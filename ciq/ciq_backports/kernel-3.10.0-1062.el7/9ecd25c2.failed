Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/9ecd25c2.failed

ice_restore_vlan and active_vlans were originally put in place to
reprogram VLAN filters in the replay path. This is now done as part
of the much broader VSI rebuild/replay framework. So remove both
ice_restore_vlan and active_vlans
