Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1062.el7/4091fb95.failed

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  followings||following

While we are here, add a missing colon in the boilerplate in DT binding
documents.  The "you SoC" in allwinner,sunxi-pinctrl.txt was fixed as
well.

I reworded "as the followings:" to "as follows:" for
drivers/usb/gadget/udc/renesas_usb3.c.

 -This document describes the functions and the interfaces of the method
 -tracing facility.
 -
 -1. Functionalities and usage examples:
 -
 -   ACPICA provides method tracing capability. And two functions are
 -   currently implemented using this capability.
 -
 -   A. Log reducer
 -   ACPICA subsystem provides debugging outputs when CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG is
 -   enabled. The debugging messages which are deployed via
 -   ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() macro can be reduced at 2 levels - per-component
 -   level (known as debug layer, configured via
 -   /sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_layer) and per-type level (known as
 -   debug level, configured via /sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_level).
 -
 -   But when the particular layer/level is applied to the control method
 -   evaluations, the quantity of the debugging outputs may still be too
 -   large to be put into the kernel log buffer. The idea thus is worked out
 -   to only enable the particular debug layer/level (normally more detailed)
 -   logs when the control method evaluation is started, and disable the
 -   detailed logging when the control method evaluation is stopped.
 -
 -   The following command examples illustrate the usage of the "log reducer"
 -   functionality:
 -   a. Filter out the debug layer/level matched logs when control methods
 -      are being evaluated:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0xXXXXXXXX" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0xYYYYYYYY" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "enable" > trace_state
 -   b. Filter out the debug layer/level matched logs when the specified
 -      control method is being evaluated:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0xXXXXXXXX" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0xYYYYYYYY" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
 -      # echo "method" > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/trace_state
 -   c. Filter out the debug layer/level matched logs when the specified
 -      control method is being evaluated for the first time:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0xXXXXXXXX" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0xYYYYYYYY" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
 -      # echo "method-once" > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/trace_state
 -   Where:
 -      0xXXXXXXXX/0xYYYYYYYY: Refer to Documentation/acpi/debug.txt for
 -			     possible debug layer/level masking values.
 -      \PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH: Full path of a control method that can be found
 -			    in the ACPI namespace. It needn't be an entry
 -			    of a control method evaluation.
 -
 -   B. AML tracer
 -
 -   There are special log entries added by the method tracing facility at
 -   the "trace points" the AML interpreter starts/stops to execute a control
 -   method, or an AML opcode. Note that the format of the log entries are
 -   subject to change:
 -     [    0.186427]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Method Begin [0xf58394d8:\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.ECOK] execution.
 -     [    0.186630]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905c88:If] execution.
 -     [    0.186820]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905cc0:LEqual] execution.
 -     [    0.187010]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905a20:-NamePath-] execution.
 -     [    0.187214]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905a20:-NamePath-] execution.
 -     [    0.187407]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
 -     [    0.187594]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
 -     [    0.187789]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905cc0:LEqual] execution.
 -     [    0.187980]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905cc0:Return] execution.
 -     [    0.188146]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
 -     [    0.188334]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
 -     [    0.188524]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905cc0:Return] execution.
 -     [    0.188712]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905c88:If] execution.

 -
 -   Developers can utilize these special log entries to track the AML
 -   interpretion, thus can aid issue debugging and performance tuning. Note
 -   that, as the "AML tracer" logs are implemented via ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT()
 -   macro, CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG is also required to be enabled for enabling
 -   "AML tracer" logs.
 -
 -   The following command examples illustrate the usage of the "AML tracer"
 -   functionality:
 -   a. Filter out the method start/stop "AML tracer" logs when control
 -      methods are being evaluated:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "enable" > trace_state
 -   b. Filter out the method start/stop "AML tracer" when the specified
 -      control method is being evaluated:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
 -      # echo "method" > trace_state
 -   c. Filter out the method start/stop "AML tracer" logs when the specified
 -      control method is being evaluated for the first time:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
 -      # echo "method-once" > trace_state
 -   d. Filter out the method/opcode start/stop "AML tracer" when the
 -      specified control method is being evaluated:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
 -      # echo "opcode" > trace_state
 -   e. Filter out the method/opcode start/stop "AML tracer" when the
 -      specified control method is being evaluated for the first time:
 -      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
 -      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
 -      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
 -      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
 -      # echo "opcode-opcode" > trace_state
 -
 -  Note that all above method tracing facility related module parameters can
 -  be used as the boot parameters, for example:
 -      acpi.trace_debug_layer=0x80 acpi.trace_debug_level=0x10 \
 -      acpi.trace_method_name=\_SB.LID0._LID acpi.trace_state=opcode-once
 -
 -2. Interface descriptions:
 -
 -   All method tracing functions can be configured via ACPI module
 -   parameters that are accessible at /sys/module/acpi/parameters/:
 -
 -   trace_method_name
 -	The full path of the AML method that the user wants to trace.
 -	Note that the full path shouldn't contain the trailing "_"s in its
 -	name segments but may contain "\" to form an absolute path.
 +trace_state
 +	The status of the tracing feature.
++<<<<<<< HEAD
  
 -   trace_debug_layer
 -	The temporary debug_layer used when the tracing feature is enabled.
 -	Using ACPI_EXECUTER (0x80) by default, which is the debug_layer
 -	used to match all "AML tracer" logs.
 +	"enabled" means this feature is enabled
 +	and the AML method is traced every time it's executed.
  
 -   trace_debug_level
 -	The temporary debug_level used when the tracing feature is enabled.
 -	Using ACPI_LV_TRACE_POINT (0x10) by default, which is the
 -	debug_level used to match all "AML tracer" logs.
 +	"1" means this feature is enabled and the AML method
 +	will only be traced during the next execution.
  
 -   trace_state
 -	The status of the tracing feature.
 +	"disabled" means this feature is disabled.
 +	Users can enable/disable this debug tracing feature by
 +	"echo string > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/trace_state".
 +	"string" should be one of "enable", "disable" and "1".
++=======
+ 	Users can enable/disable this debug tracing feature by executing
+ 	the following command:
+ 	    # echo string > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/trace_state
+ 	Where "string" should be one of the following:
+ 	"disable"
+ 	    Disable the method tracing feature.
+ 	"enable"
+ 	    Enable the method tracing feature.
+ 	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
+ 	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during any method
+ 	    execution will be logged.
+ 	"method"
+ 	    Enable the method tracing feature.
+ 	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
+ 	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method execution
+ 	    of "trace_method_name" will be logged.
+ 	"method-once"
+ 	    Enable the method tracing feature.
+ 	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
+ 	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method execution
+ 	    of "trace_method_name" will be logged only once.
+ 	"opcode"
+ 	    Enable the method tracing feature.
+ 	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
+ 	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method/opcode
+ 	    execution of "trace_method_name" will be logged.
+ 	"opcode-once"
+ 	    Enable the method tracing feature.
+ 	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
+ 	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method/opcode
+ 	    execution of "trace_method_name" will be logged only once.
+ 	Note that, the difference between the "enable" and other feature
+         enabling options are:
+ 	1. When "enable" is specified, since
+ 	   "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" shall apply to all control
+ 	   method evaluations, after configuring "trace_state" to "enable",
+ 	   "trace_method_name" will be reset to NULL.
+ 	2. When "method/opcode" is specified, if
+ 	   "trace_method_name" is NULL when "trace_state" is configured to
+ 	   these options, the "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" will
+ 	   apply to all control method evaluations.
