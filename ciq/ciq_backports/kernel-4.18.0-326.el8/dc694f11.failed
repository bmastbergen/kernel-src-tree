Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/dc694f11.failed

When SF id is unavailable, code jumps to wrong label that accesses
sw id array outside of its range.
Hence, when SF id is not allocated, avoid accessing such array.
