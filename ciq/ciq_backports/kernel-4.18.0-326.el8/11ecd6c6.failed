In order to offload sample action, HW introduces sampler object. The
sampler object samples packets according to the provided sample ratio.
Sampled packets are duplicated. One copy is processed by a termination
table, named the sample table, which sends the packet up to software.
The second copy is processed by the default table.

Instantiate sampler object. Re-use identical sampler object for
the same sample ratio, sample table and default table as a prestep for
offloading tc sample actions.
