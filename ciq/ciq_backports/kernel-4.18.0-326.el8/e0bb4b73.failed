Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/e0bb4b73.failed

Per SMMUv3 spec, there is no Size and Addr field in the PREFETCH_CONFIG
command and they're not used by the driver. Remove them.

We can add them back if we're going to use PREFETCH_ADDR in the future.
