Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/6acfb5ba.failed

Since commit d6995da31122 ("hugetlb: use page.private for hugetlb specific
page flags") converts page.private for hugetlb specific page flags.  We
should use hugetlb_page_subpool() to get the subpool pointer instead of
page_private().

This 'could' prevent the migration of hugetlb pages.  page_private(hpage)
is now used for hugetlb page specific flags.  At migration time, the only
flag which could be set is HPageVmemmapOptimized.  This flag will only be
set if the new vmemmap reduction feature is enabled.  In addition,
!page_mapping() implies an anonymous mapping.  So, this will prevent
migration of hugetb pages in anonymous mappings if the vmemmap reduction
feature is enabled.

In addition, that if statement checked for the rare race condition of a
page being migrated while in the process of being freed.  Since that check
is now wrong, we could leak hugetlb subpool usage counts.

The commit forgot to update it in the page migration routine.  So fix it.
