Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/d86f43b1.failed

It makes USB audio capture and playback possible and pristine on my Roland
INTEGRA-7, Boutique D-05, and R-26, along with many more I've encountered
people having had issues with over the last decade or so.
