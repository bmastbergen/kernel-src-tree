When auxiliary bus autoprobe is disabled and SF is in ACTIVE state,
on SF port deletion it transitions from ACTIVE->ALLOCATED->INVALID.

When VHCA event handler queries the state, it is already transition
to INVALID state.

In this scenario, event handler missed to delete the SF device.

Fix it by deleting the SF when SF state is INVALID.
