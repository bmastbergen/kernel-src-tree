Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/1b988997.failed

All Intel TigerLake platforms should support the feature of getting
the system state from acpi to deal with S0ix support.

This was missed in previous commits, likely due to copy/paste from
older code.
