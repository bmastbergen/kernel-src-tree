Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/0e764a01.failed

Some client devices want to directly map the IOMMU themselves instead
of using the DMA domain. Allow those devices to opt in to direct
mapping by way of a list of compatible strings.
