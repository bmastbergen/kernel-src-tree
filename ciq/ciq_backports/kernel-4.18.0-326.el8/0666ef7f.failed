Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/0666ef7f.failed

The adapter state can be added or deleted over different versions
of the source code. Print a string instead of a number.
