Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/7a009a70.failed

Move the pre-check to the function that handles all SOL_SOCKET values.

At this point there is complete coverage for all values that were
accepted by the pre-check.

BUSYPOLL functions are accepted but will not have any functionality
yet until its clear how the expected mptcp behaviour should look like.
