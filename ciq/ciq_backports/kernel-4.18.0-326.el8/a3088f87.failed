Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/a3088f87.failed

Device has SF ids in two different contiguous ranges. One for the local
controller and second for the external controller's PF.

Each such range has its own maximum number of functions and base id.
To allocate SF from either of the range, prepare code to split into
range specific fields into its own structure.
