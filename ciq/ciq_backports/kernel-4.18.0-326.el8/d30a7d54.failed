Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/d30a7d54.failed

cnt was not used in nft_meta.sh
This patch also fixes 2 shellcheck SC2181 warnings:
"check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with
$?."
