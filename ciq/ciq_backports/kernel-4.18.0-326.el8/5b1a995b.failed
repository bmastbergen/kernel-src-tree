Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/5b1a995b.failed

When some test directly done with check_one_counter() fails,
counter variable is undefined. This patch calls ip with cname
which avoids errors like:
FAIL: oskuidcounter, want "packets 2", got
Error: syntax error, unexpected newline, expecting string
list counter inet filter
                        ^
Error is now correctly rendered:
FAIL: oskuidcounter, want "packets 2", got
table inet filter {
	counter oskuidcounter {
		packets 1 bytes 84
	}
}
