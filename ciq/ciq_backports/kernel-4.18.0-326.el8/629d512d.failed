The msr_pstate union struct named fam17h_bits is misleading since
this is the struct to use for all families >= 0x17, not just
for family 0x17. Rename the bits structs to be 'pstate' (for pre
family 17h CPUs) and 'pstatedef' (for CPUs since fam 17h) to align
closer with PPR/BDKG (1) naming.

There are no functional changes as part of this update.
