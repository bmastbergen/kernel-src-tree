When a SF is inactivated and when it is in a TEARDOWN_REQUEST
state, driver still returns its state as active. This is incorrect.
Fix it by treating TEARDOWN_REQEUST as inactive state. When a SF
is still attached to the driver, on user request to reactivate EINVAL
error is returned. Inform user about it with better code EBUSY and
informative error message.
