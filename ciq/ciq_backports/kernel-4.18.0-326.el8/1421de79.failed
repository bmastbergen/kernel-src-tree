Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/1421de79.failed

The pscur variable is set but not uused, just remove it.

This may have previsously been set to validate the MSR_AMD_PSTATE_STATUS
MSR. With the addition of the CPUPOWER_CAP_AMD_HW_PSTATE cap flag this
is no longer needed since the cpuid bit to enable this cap flag also
validates that the MSR_AMD_PSTATE_STATUS MSR is present.
