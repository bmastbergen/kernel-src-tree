Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/21f05a43.failed

The ACPI_PLATFORM_PROFILE option essentially provides a library and not
really an independent module. Thus it seems to be more user-friendly to
hide this option and simply make drivers depending on it select it.
