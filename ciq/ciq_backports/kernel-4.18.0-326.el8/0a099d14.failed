Update tcpbpf_user.c to make use of the BPF skeleton. Doing this we can
simplify test_tcpbpf_user and reduce the overhead involved in setting up
the test.

In addition we can clean up the remaining bits such as the one remaining
CHECK_FAIL at the end of test_tcpbpf_user so that the function only makes
use of CHECK as needed.
