Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-326.el8/884c7094.failed

The implicit feedback quirk table contains the entries that also
appear in the capture quirks, and those are all handled to be
skipped.  For the code simplicity, drop the duped entries in the
playback quirk table, and check the match with the capture quirk table
instead.
