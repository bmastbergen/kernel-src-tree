Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Pioneer devices have both playback and capture streams sharing the
same iface/altsetting, and those need to be paired as implicit
feedback.  Instead of a half-baked (and broken) static quirk entry,
set up more generically for those devices by checking the number of
endpoints and the attribute of the secondary EP.
