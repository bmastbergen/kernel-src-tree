Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/21137301.failed

The kvm_vcpu_pmu_{read,write}_evtype_direct functions do not handle
the cycle counter use-case, this leads to inaccurate counts and a
WARN message when using perf with the cycle counter (-e cycle).

Let's fix this by adding a use case for pmccfiltr_el0.
