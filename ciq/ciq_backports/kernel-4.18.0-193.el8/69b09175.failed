Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/69b09175.failed

CHECK macro implicitly uses duration. We call CHECK() a couple of times
before duration is initialized from bpf_prog_test_run().
Explicitly set duration to 0 to avoid compiler warnings.
