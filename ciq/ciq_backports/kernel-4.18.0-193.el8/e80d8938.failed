Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/e80d8938.failed

Since following path was merged in 5.4-rc3,
auto-tuning feature in threads-max does not exist any more.
Fix the admin-guide document as is.

  If a value outside of this range is written to threads-max an error
  EINVAL occurs.
  
++<<<<<<< HEAD:Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt
 +The value written is checked against the available RAM pages. If the
 +thread structures would occupy too much (more than 1/8th) of the
 +available RAM pages threads-max is reduced accordingly.
