Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/580205dd.failed

Fix two issues in test_attach_probe:

1. it was not able to parse /proc/self/maps beyond the first line,
   since %s means parse string until white space.
2. offset has to be accounted for otherwise uprobed address is incorrect.
