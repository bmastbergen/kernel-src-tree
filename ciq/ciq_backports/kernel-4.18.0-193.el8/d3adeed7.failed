Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/d3adeed7.failed

As a hangover from when this code used a designated initialiser, we've
been using commas to terminate the arm_pmu field assignments. Whilst
harmless, it's also weird, so replace them with semicolons instead.
