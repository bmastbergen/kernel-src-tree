Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/845426f3.failed

Writing '1' to /sys/kernel/fadump_release_opalcore would release the
memory held by kernel in exporting /sys/firmware/opal/core file.
