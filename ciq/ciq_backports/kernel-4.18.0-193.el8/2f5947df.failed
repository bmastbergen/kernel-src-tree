Rebuild_History Non-Buildable kernel-4.18.0-193.el8

commit 2f5947dfcaecb99f2dd559156eecbeb7b95e4c02
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/2f5947df.failed

Renaming docs seems to be en vogue at the moment, so fix on of the
grossly misnamed directories.  We usually never use "virtual" as
a shortcut for virtualization in the kernel, but always virt,
as seen in the virt/ top-level directory.  Fix up the documentation
to match that.

Fixes: ed16648eb5b8 ("Move kvm, uml, and lguest subdirectories under a common "virtual" directory, I.E:")

-Paravirt_ops
-============
-
-Linux provides support for different hypervisor virtualization technologies.
-Historically different binary kernels would be required in order to support
-different hypervisors, this restriction was removed with pv_ops.
-Linux pv_ops is a virtualization API which enables support for different
-hypervisors. It allows each hypervisor to override critical operations and
-allows a single kernel binary to run on all supported execution environments
-including native machine -- without any hypervisors.
-
-pv_ops provides a set of function pointers which represent operations
-corresponding to low level critical instructions and high level
-functionalities in various areas. pv-ops allows for optimizations at run
-time by enabling binary patching of the low-ops critical operations
-at boot time.
-
-pv_ops operations are classified into three categories:
-
-- simple indirect call
-  These operations correspond to high level functionality where it is
-  known that the overhead of indirect call isn't very important.
-
-- indirect call which allows optimization with binary patch
-  Usually these operations correspond to low level critical instructions. They
-  are called frequently and are performance critical. The overhead is
-  very important.
-
-- a set of macros for hand written assembly code
-  Hand written assembly codes (.S files) also need paravirtualization
-  because they include sensitive instructions or some of code paths in
-  them are very performance critical.
