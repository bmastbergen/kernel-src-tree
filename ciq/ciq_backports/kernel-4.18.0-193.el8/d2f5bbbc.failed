Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/d2f5bbbc.failed

The progs for bpf selftests use several different notations to force
function inlining. Standardize to what most of them use,
static __always_inline.
