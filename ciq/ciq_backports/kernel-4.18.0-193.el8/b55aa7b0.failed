Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/b55aa7b0.failed

Adding verifier tests to ensure the ptr returned from bpf_tcp_sock() and
bpf_sk_fullsock() cannot be accessed after bpf_sk_release() is called.
A few of the tests are derived from a reproducer test by Lorenz Bauer.
