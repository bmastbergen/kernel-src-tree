In order to remove rtnl lock dependency from flow_action representation
translator, change rtnl_dereference() to rcu_dereference_protected() in ct
action helpers that provide external access to zone and action values. This
is safe to do because the functions are not called from anywhere else
outside flow_action infrastructure which was modified to obtain tcf_lock
when accessing action data in one of previous patches in the series.
