Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/210369dc.failed

Make the process_command take any help command and command list.  This
will make it easier to help commands and a command list for CascadeLake-N.
