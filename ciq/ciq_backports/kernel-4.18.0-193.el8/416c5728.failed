Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/416c5728.failed

When tests fail because sysctl() unexpectedly succeeds, they print an
inappropriate "Unexpected failure" message and a random errno. Zero
out errno before calling sysctl() and replace the message with
"Unexpected success".
