Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/6cc070bd.failed

The error handling was a bit flipped around.  If the mlx5_create_flow_group()
function failed then it would have resulted in dereferencing "fg" when
it was an error pointer.
