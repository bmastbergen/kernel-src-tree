There is a race in this test between receiving the ACK for the
single-byte packet sent in the test, and reading the values from the
map.

This patch fixes this by having the client wait until there are no more
unacknowledged packets.

Before:
for i in {1..1000}; do ../net/in_netns.sh ./test_tcp_rtt; \
done | grep -c PASSED
< trimmed error messages >
993

After:
for i in {1..10000}; do ../net/in_netns.sh ./test_tcp_rtt; \
done | grep -c PASSED
10000
