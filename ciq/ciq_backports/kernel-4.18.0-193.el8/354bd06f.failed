Introduce --auto|-a option to base-freq enable feature, so that it
does in one step for users who are OK by setting all cores with higher
base frequency to be set in CLOS 0 and remaining in CLOS 3. This option
also sets corresponding clos.min to CLOS 0 and CLOS3. In this way, users
don't have to take multiple steps to enable base-freq feature. For users
who want more fine grain control, they can always use core-power feature
to set custom CLOS configuration and assignment.

Also adjust cpufreq/scaling_min_freq for higher and lower priority cores.

For example user can use:
intel-speed-select base-freq enable --auto
