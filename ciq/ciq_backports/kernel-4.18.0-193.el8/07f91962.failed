Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/07f91962.failed

Test the case when reg->smax_value is too small/big and can overflow,
and separately min and max values outside of stack bounds.

Example of output:
  # ./test_verifier
  #856/p indirect variable-offset stack access, unbounded OK
  #857/p indirect variable-offset stack access, max out of bound OK
  #858/p indirect variable-offset stack access, min out of bound OK
