Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/949ffc8b.failed

[why]
During mode transition steer fifo could overflow. Quite often it
recovers by itself, but sometimes it doesn't.

[how]
Add steer fifo reset before unblanking the stream. Also add a short
delay when resetting dig resync fifo to make sure register writes
don't end up back-to-back, in which case the HW might miss the reset
request.
