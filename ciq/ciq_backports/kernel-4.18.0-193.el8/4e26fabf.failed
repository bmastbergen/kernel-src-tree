Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The turbo-freq feature is dependent on the core-power feature. If the
core-power feature is disabled while the turbo-freq feature is enabled,
this will break the turbo-freq feature. This is a firmware limitation,
where they can't return error under this scenario.

So when trying to disable core-power, make sure that the turbo-freq
feature is not enabled. If it enabled, return error if user is trying to
disable the core-power feature.
