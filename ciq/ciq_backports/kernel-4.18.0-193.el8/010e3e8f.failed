Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/010e3e8f.failed

In order to subsequently add more tests for the arm64 architecture we
compile the tests target for arm64 systematically.

Further explanation provided by Mark Rutland:

Given prior questions regarding this commit, it's probably worth
spelling things out more explicitly, e.g.

  Currently we only build the arm64/tests directory if
  CONFIG_DWARF_UNWIND is selected, which is fine as the only test we
  have is arm64/tests/dwarf-unwind.o.

  So that we can add more tests to the test directory, let's
  unconditionally build the directory, but conditionally build
  dwarf-unwind.o depending on CONFIG_DWARF_UNWIND.

  There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
