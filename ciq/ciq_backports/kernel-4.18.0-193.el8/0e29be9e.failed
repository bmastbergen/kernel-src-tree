Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/0e29be9e.failed

Removing this causes hangs in some games, so re-add it, but add
a timeout so we don't hang while switching flip types.
