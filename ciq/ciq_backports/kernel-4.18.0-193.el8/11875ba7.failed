Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/11875ba7.failed

Out of the three nc implementations widely in use, at least two (BSD netcat
and nmap-ncat) do not support -l combined with -s. Modify the nc invocation
to be accepted by all of them.
