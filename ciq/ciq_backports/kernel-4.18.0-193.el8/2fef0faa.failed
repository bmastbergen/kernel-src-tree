Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/2fef0faa.failed

[why]
Some ODM-related register settings are inconsistently updated by VBIOS, causing
the state in DC to be invalid, which would then end up crashing in certain
use-cases (such as disable/enable device).

[how]
Check the enabled status of the second pipe when determining the number of
OPTC sources. If the second pipe is disabled, set the number of sources to 1
regardless of other settings (that may not be updated correctly).
