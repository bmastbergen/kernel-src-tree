Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/a5cb3346.failed

Rewrite selftest to iterate over an array with input packet and
expected flow_keys. This should make it easier to extend this test
with additional cases without too much boilerplate.
