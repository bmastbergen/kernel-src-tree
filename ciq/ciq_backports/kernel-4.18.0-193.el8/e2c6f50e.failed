Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/e2c6f50e.failed

RISC-V does, in-general, not have "efficient unaligned access". When
testing the RISC-V BPF JIT, some selftests failed in the verification
due to misaligned access. Annotate these tests with the
F_NEEDS_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS flag.
