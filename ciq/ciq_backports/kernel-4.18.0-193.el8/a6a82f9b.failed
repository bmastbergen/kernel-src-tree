Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/a6a82f9b.failed

Introduce --auto|-a option to turbo-freq enable feature, so that it
does in one step for users who are OK by setting all passed target cores
as high priority and set in CLOS 0 and remaining in CLOS 3. In this way,
users don't have to take multiple steps to enable turbo-freq feature. For
users who want more fine grain control, they can always use core-power
feature to set custom CLOS configuration and assignment.

While here also print the error to output when clos configuration fails.

For example
intel-speed-select -c 0-4 turbo-freq enable --auto

The above command will enable turbo-freq and core-power feature. Also
mark CPU 0 to CPU 4 as high priority.
