Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/add66fcb.failed

On architectures where loff_t is wider than pgoff_t, the expression
((page->index + 1) << PAGE_SHIFT) can overflow.  Rewrite to use the page
offset, which we already compute here anyway.
