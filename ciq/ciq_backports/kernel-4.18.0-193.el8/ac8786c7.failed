Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/ac8786c7.failed

There are currently no tests for ALU64 shift operations when the shift
amount is 0. This adds 6 new tests to make sure they are equivalent
to a no-op. The x32 JIT had such bugs that could have been caught by
these tests.
