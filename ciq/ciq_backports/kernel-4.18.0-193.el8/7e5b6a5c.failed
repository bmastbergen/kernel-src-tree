Clang static analysis reports this problem
route.c:425:4: warning: Use of memory after it is freed
  trace_mctp_key_acquire(key);
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When mctp_key_add() fails, key is freed but then is later
used in trace_mctp_key_acquire().  Add an else statement
to use the key only when mctp_key_add() is successful.
