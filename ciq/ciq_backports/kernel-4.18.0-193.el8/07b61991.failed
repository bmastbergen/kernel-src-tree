Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/07b61991.failed

There are a few tests which call bpf_object__close on uninitialized
bpf_object*, which may segfault. Explicitly zero-initialise these pointers
to avoid this.
