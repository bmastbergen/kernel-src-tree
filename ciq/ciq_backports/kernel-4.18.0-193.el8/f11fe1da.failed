Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/f11fe1da.failed

If NF_NAT is m and NET_ACT_CT is y, build fails:

net/sched/act_ct.o: In function `tcf_ct_act':
act_ct.c:(.text+0x21ac): undefined reference to `nf_ct_nat_ext_add'
act_ct.c:(.text+0x229a): undefined reference to `nf_nat_icmp_reply_translation'
act_ct.c:(.text+0x233a): undefined reference to `nf_nat_setup_info'
