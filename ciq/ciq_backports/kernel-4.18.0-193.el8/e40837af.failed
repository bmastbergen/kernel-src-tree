Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/e40837af.failed

[Why]
These are needed to send back DRM vblank events in the case where VRR
is on. Without the interrupt enabled we're deferring the events into the
vblank queue and userspace is left waiting forever to get back the
events they need.

Found using igt@kms_vrr - the test fails immediately due to vblank
timeout.

[How]
Register them the same way we're handling it for DCN1.

This fixes igt@kms_vrr for DCN2.
