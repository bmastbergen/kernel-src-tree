Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

In virtiofs we keep per queue connected state in virtio_fs_vq->connected
and use that to end request if queue is not connected. And virtiofs does
not even touch fpq->connected state.

We probably need to merge these two at some point of time. For now,
simplify the code a bit and do not worry about checking state of
fpq->connected.
