Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/92e0e87d.failed

Additional Turbo Ratio Limit (TRL) MSRs are required to get bucket vs core
count relationship. So add them to the list of allowed MSRs.
