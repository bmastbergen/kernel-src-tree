Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/b850a821.failed

The current code handles only counters that attached to dest, we still
have the cases where we have counter on non-dest, like over drop etc.
