Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/3e068269.failed

If the result of the division is LLONG_MIN, current tests do not detect
the error since the return value is truncated to a 32-bit value and ends
up being 0.
