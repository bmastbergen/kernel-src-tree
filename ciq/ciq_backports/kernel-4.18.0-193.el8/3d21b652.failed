Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/3d21b652.failed

In case we are not running in a namespace (which we don't do by default),
let's try to detach the bpf program that we use for eth_get_headlen tests.
