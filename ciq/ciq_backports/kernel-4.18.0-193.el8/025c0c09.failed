Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/025c0c09.failed

attach_probe test fails, because it cannot install a kprobe on a
non-existent sys_nanosleep symbol.

Use the correct symbol name for the nanosleep syscall on 64-bit s390.
Don't bother adding one for 31-bit mode, since tests are compiled only
in 64-bit mode.
