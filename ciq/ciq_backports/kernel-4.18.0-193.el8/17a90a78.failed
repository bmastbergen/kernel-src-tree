Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/17a90a78.failed

Add a test on egress that a large TCP packet successfully goes through
the lwt+bpf encap tunnel.

Although there is no direct evidence that GSO worked, as opposed to
e.g. TCP segmentation or IP fragmentation (maybe a kernel stats counter
should be added to track the number of failed GSO attempts?), without
the previous patch in the patchset this test fails, and printk-debugging
showed that software-based GSO succeeded here (veth is not compatible with
SKB_GSO_DODGY, so GSO happens in the software stack).

Also removed an unnecessary nodad and added a missed failed flag.
