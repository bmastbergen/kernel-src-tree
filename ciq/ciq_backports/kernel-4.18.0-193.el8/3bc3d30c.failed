Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/3bc3d30c.failed

cpumasks are allocated by calling the alloc_cpu_mask() function and are
never free'd.  They should be free'd after the commands have run.

Fix the memory leaks by calling free_cpu_set().
