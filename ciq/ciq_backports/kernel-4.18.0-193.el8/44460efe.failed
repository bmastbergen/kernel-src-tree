If the CPU package has the less logical CPU than topo_max_cpus, but un-present
CPU's punit_cpu_core will be initiated to 0 and they will be count to core 0

Like below, there are only 10 high priority cores (20 logical CPUs) in the CPU
package, but it count to 27 logic CPUs.

./intel-speed-select base-freq info -l 0 | grep mask
        high-priority-cpu-mask:7f000179,f000179f

With the fix patch:
./intel-speed-select base-freq info -l 0
        high-priority-cpu-mask:00000179,f000179f
