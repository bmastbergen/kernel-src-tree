Naresh reported LTP diotest4 failing for 32bit x86 and arm -next
kernels on ext4. Same problem exists in 5.4-rc7 on xfs.

The failure comes down to:
  openat(AT_FDCWD, "testdata-4.5918", O_RDWR|O_DIRECT) = 4
  mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xb7f7b000
  read(4, 0xb7f7b000, 4096)              = 0 // expects -EFAULT

Problem is conversion at iomap_dio_bio_actor() return. Ternary
operator has a return type and an attempt is made to convert each
of operands to the type of the other. In this case "ret" (int)
is converted to type of "copied" (unsigned long). Both have size
of 4 bytes:
    size_t copied = 0;
    int ret = -14;
    long long actor_ret = copied ? copied : ret;

    On x86_64: actor_ret == -14;
    On x86   : actor_ret == 4294967282

Replace ternary operator with 2 return statements to avoid this
unwanted conversion.
