Commands which causes PUNIT writes, store them and restore them on system
resume. The driver stores all such requests in a hash table and stores the
the latest mailbox request parameters. On resume these commands mail box
commands are executed again. There are only 5 such mail box commands which
will trigger such processing so a very low overhead in store and execute
on resume. Also there is no order requirement for mail box commands for
these write/set commands. There is one MSR request for changing turbo
ratio limits, this also stored and get restored on resume and cpu online.
