Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/21c3390d.failed

Use different frequency weights for CLOS 0 and and CLOS1-3, to define
relative priority for power budgeting. This will be used for --auto
mode to enable base-freq and turbo-freq feature.
