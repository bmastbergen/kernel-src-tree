There are some platforms, where there limited support of Intel(R) SST
features. Here perf-profile has only one base configuration and limited
support of commands. But still has support for discovery of base-freq and
turbo-freq features. So it is important to show minimum features to use
base-freq and turbo-freq features.

Here the change are:
- When there is no support of CONFIG_TDP_GET_LEVELS_INFO, then instead
of treating this as fatal error, treat this with number of config levels
= 0, that means only base level 0 is present.
- There is no support of mail box commands to get base frequencies or
turbo frequencies. Here present base frequency by reading cpufreq
base freq and turbo frequency by reading MSR 0x1AD.
- Don't display any field, which has value == 0.
