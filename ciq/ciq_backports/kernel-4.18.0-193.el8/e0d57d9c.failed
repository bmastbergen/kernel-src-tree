Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/e0d57d9c.failed

Add a missing spinlock around XSKICOSQ usage at the activation stage,
because there is a race between a configuration change and the
application calling sendto().
