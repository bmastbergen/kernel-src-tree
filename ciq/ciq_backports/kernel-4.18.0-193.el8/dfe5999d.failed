Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/dfe5999d.failed

This a new feature, it is preferred that it defaults to N.
We will probe the feature support from userspace before actually using it.
