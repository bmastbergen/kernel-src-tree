Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/cfff578e.failed

We don't have this helper if the kernel was compiled without
CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS. Setting prog_type to BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACEPOINT
let's verifier correctly skip this test based on the missing
prog_type support in the kernel.
