While using new non arhitectural features using PUNIT Mailbox and MMIO
read/write interface, still there is need to operate using MSRs to
control PUNIT. User space could have used user user-space MSR interface for
this, but when user space MSR access is disabled, then it can't. Here only
limited number of MSRs are allowed using this new interface.
