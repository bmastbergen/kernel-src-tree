Changes to function "smu_suspend" in amdgpu_smu.c is a workaround.

We should get real information about if baco is enabled or not, while we
always consider APU SMU feature as enabled in current code.

I know APU do not support baco mode for GPU reset, so I use
"adev->flags" to skip function "smu_feature_is_enabled".
