When run_kselftests.sh is run, it hangs after test_tc_tunnel.sh. The reason
is test_tc_tunnel.sh ensures the server ('nc -l') is run all the time,
starting it again every time it is expected to terminate. The exception is
the final client_connect: the server is not started anymore, which ensures
no process is kept running after the test is finished.

For a sit test, though, the script is terminated prematurely without the
final client_connect and the 'nc' process keeps running. This in turn causes
the run_one function in kselftest/runner.sh to hang forever, waiting for the
runaway process to finish.

Ensure a remaining server is terminated on cleanup.
