Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/fe3ee1ec.failed

On the gaming mice, there are 2 interfaces, one for the mouse and one
for the macros. Better allow everybody to go through hid-logitech-hidpp
than trying to be smarter.
