devpts_pty_kill(): don't bother with d_delete()

commit 46c46f8df9aa425cc4d6bc89d57a6fedf83dc797
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/46c46f8d.failed

we are not retaining dentries there anyway (simple_dentry_operations),
so d_delete()+dput() == d_drop()+dput()
