Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-193.el8/20055a8b.failed

For sizes lesser than 128 bytes, the code branches out early without saving
the stack frame, which when restored later drops frame of the caller.
