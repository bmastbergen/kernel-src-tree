Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-315.el8/35d8a973.failed

Fix error in Kconfig that exposed INTEL_PMT_CLASS as a user selectable
option. It is already selected by INTEL_PMT_TELEMETRY and
INTEL_PMT_CRASHLOG which are user selectable.
