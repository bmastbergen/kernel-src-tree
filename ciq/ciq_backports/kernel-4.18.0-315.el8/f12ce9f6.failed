Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Draft P802.11ax_D2.5 defines the following capabilities that
can be negotiated using RSNXE capabilities:

- Secure LTF measurement exchange protocol.
- Secure RTT measurement exchange protocol.
- Management frame protection for all management frames exchanged
  during the negotiation and range measurement procedure.

Extend the nl80211 API to allow drivers to declare support for
these new capabilities as part of extended feature.
