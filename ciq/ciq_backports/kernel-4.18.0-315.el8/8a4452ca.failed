Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-315.el8/8a4452ca.failed

The ena.rst documentation referred to end_start_xmit() when it should refer
to ena_start_xmit(). Fix the typo.
