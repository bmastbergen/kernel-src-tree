Compiling samples/bpf hits an error related to fallthrough marking.
    ...
    CC  samples/bpf/hbm.o
  samples/bpf/hbm.c: In function ‘main’:
  samples/bpf/hbm.c:486:4: error: ‘fallthrough’ undeclared (first use in this function)
      fallthrough;
      ^~~~~~~~~~~

The "fallthrough" is not defined under tools/include directory.
Rather, it is "__fallthrough" is defined in linux/compiler.h.
Including "linux/compiler.h" and using "__fallthrough" fixed the issue.
