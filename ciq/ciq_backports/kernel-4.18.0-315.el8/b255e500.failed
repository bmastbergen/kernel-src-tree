net: documentation: build a directory structure for drivers

commit b255e500c8dc111dd9efac1442a85a0dac913feb
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-315.el8/b255e500.failed

Documentation/networking/ is full of cryptically named files with
driver documentation.  This makes finding interesting information
at a glance really hard.  Move all those files into a directory
called device_drivers (since not all drivers are for device) and
fix up references.

RFC v0.1 -> RFC v1:
 - also add .txt suffix to the files which are missing it (Quentin)

++<<<<<<< HEAD
++=======
+ For an overview of the DPAA2 architecture and fsl-mc bus see:
+ Documentation/networking/device_drivers/freescale/dpaa2/overview.rst
+ 
+ As described in the above overview, all DPAA2 objects in a DPRC share the
+ same hardware "isolation context" and a 10-bit value called an ICID
+ (isolation context id) is expressed by the hardware to identify
+ the requester.
+ 
+ The generic 'iommus' property is insufficient to describe the relationship
+ between ICIDs and IOMMUs, so an iommu-map property is used to define
+ the set of possible ICIDs under a root DPRC and how they map to
+ an IOMMU.
+ 
+ For generic IOMMU bindings, see
+ Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt.
+ 
+ For arm-smmu binding, see:
+ Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/arm,smmu.txt.
