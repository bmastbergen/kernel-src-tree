Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-315.el8/a1a5c1c3.failed

Some products will be available that have PMT capabilities that are not
supported. Remove the warnings in this instance to avoid nuisance messages
and confusion.

Also return an error code for capabilities that are disabled by quirk to
prevent them from keeping the driver loaded if only disabled capabilities
are found.
