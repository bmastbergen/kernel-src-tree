Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-315.el8/294a7f16.failed

A build condition was missing around a compilation test, this compilation
test comes from the original test_bitfield code.

And removed unnecessary code for this test.
