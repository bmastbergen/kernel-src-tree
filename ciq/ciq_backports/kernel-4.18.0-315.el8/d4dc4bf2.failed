Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-315.el8/d4dc4bf2.failed

Fixes off-by-one bugs in the macro assignments for the crashlog control
bits. Was initially tested on emulation but bug revealed after testing on
silicon.
