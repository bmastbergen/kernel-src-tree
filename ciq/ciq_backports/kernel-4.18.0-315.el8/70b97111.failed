Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-315.el8/70b97111.failed

The local_storage->list will be traversed by rcu reader in parallel.
Thus, hlist_add_head_rcu() is needed in bpf_selem_link_storage_nolock().
This patch fixes it.

This part of the code has recently been refactored in bpf-next
and this patch makes changes to the new file "bpf_local_storage.c".
Instead of using the original offending commit in the Fixes tag,
the commit that created the file "bpf_local_storage.c" is used.

A separate fix has been provided to the bpf tree.
