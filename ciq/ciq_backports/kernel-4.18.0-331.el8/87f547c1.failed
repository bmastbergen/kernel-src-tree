Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/87f547c1.failed

A remote endpoint (immediate neighbors node) can forward services
from other nodes (non-immadiate), in that case ctrl packet node ID
(offering distant service) can differ from the qrtr source node
(forwarding the packet).
