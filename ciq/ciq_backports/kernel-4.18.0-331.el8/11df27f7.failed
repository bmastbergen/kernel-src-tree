commit 11df27f7fdf02cc2bb354358ad482e1fdd690589
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/11df27f7.failed

Specify the interface through which packets should be transmitted so
that the test will pass regardless of the libnet version against which
mausezahn is linked.

Fixes: cab14d1087d9 ("selftests: Add version of router_multipath.sh using nexthop objects")
Fixes: 3d578d879517 ("selftests: forwarding: Test IPv4 weighted nexthops")
