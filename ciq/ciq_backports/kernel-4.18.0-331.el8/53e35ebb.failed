Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/53e35ebb.failed

We recently added some new locking to this function but one error path
was overlooked.  We need to drop the lock before returning.
