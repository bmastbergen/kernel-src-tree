Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/ccacb703.failed

There is no competition to get more LOCs into the kernel, and driver can look
better and have improved readability without those additional line breaks.

While at it, shorten info structures that they are all PCI, at the end it's
a PCI driver for Intel hardware.
