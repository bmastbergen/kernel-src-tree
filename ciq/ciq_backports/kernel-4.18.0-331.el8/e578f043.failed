Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/e578f043.failed

Copy'n'paste without thinking is not a good idea and in this case it brought
unnecessary loop over PCI BAR resources which was needed to workaround one of
STMicro RVP boards. Remove unnecessary loops from Intel driver.
