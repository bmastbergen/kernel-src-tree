Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/e22626a8.failed

In commit 7d189f617f83f ("vdpa_sim_blk: implement ramdisk behaviour")
linux/blkdev.h was included here causing the duplicate include.
Remove the later duplicate include.
