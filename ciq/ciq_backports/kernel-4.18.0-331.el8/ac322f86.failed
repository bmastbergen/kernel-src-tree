Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/ac322f86.failed

While unloading the dwmac-intel driver, clk_disable_unprepare() is
being called twice in stmmac_dvr_remove() and
intel_eth_pci_remove(). This causes kernel panic on the second call.

Removing the second call of clk_disable_unprepare() in
intel_eth_pci_remove().
