Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/0e786f32.failed

Fix the following sparse warning:

drivers/hwmon/k10temp.c:189:12: warning: symbol 'k10temp_temp_label' was
not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/hwmon/k10temp.c:202:12: warning: symbol 'k10temp_in_label' was
not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/hwmon/k10temp.c:207:12: warning: symbol 'k10temp_curr_label' was
not declared. Should it be static?
