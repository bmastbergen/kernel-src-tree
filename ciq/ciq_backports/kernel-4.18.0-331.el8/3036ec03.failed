Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/3036ec03.failed

The PCI device IDs are defined with a prefix PCI_DEVICE_ID.
There is no need to repeat the ID part at the end of each definition.
