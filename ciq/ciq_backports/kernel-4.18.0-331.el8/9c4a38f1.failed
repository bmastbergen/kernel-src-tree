 - * Implementation notes:
 - * - CCD1 and CCD2 register address information as well as the calculation to
 - *   convert raw register values is from https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower.
 - *   The information is not confirmed from chip datasheets, but experiments
 - *   suggest that it provides reasonable temperature values.
 - * - Register addresses to read chip voltage and current are also from
 - *   https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower, and not confirmed from chip
 - *   datasheets. Current calibration is board specific and not typically
 - *   shared by board vendors. For this reason, current values are
 - *   normalized to report 1A/LSB for core current and and 0.25A/LSB for SoC
 - *   current. Reported values can be adjusted using the sensors configuration
 - *   file.
 - * - It is unknown if the mechanism to read CCD1/CCD2 temperature as well as
 - *   current and voltage information works on higher-end Ryzen CPUs.
 - *   Information reported by Windows tools suggests that additional sensors
 - *   (both temperature and voltage/current) are supported, but their register
 - *   location is currently unknown.
