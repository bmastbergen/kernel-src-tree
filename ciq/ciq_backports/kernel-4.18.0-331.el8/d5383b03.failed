Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/d5383b03.failed

There are useless conditions like

	func()
	{
		...
		int ret;
		...
		ret = foo();
		if (ret)
			return ret;

		return 0;
	}

which may be replaced with direct return statement, what we have done here.
