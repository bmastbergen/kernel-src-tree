Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-331.el8/8999eabf.failed

The debugfs code was intended to aid figuring out functionality
of undocumented registers. Turns out that wasn't very helpful,
since register locations change too much between AMD chip revisions,
and the data isn't really valuable for chips where it isn't already
supported. On top of that, its existence has been used as argument
for providing pseudo-API debugfs functions in other drivers.
So let's just take it out.

 - * Implementation notes:
 - * - CCD register address information as well as the calculation to
 - *   convert raw register values is from https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower.
 - *   The information is not confirmed from chip datasheets, but experiments
 - *   suggest that it provides reasonable temperature values.
 - * - Register addresses to read chip voltage and current are also from
 - *   https://github.com/ocerman/zenpower, and not confirmed from chip
 - *   datasheets. Current calibration is board specific and not typically
 - *   shared by board vendors. For this reason, current values are
 - *   normalized to report 1A/LSB for core current and and 0.25A/LSB for SoC
 - *   current. Reported values can be adjusted using the sensors configuration
 - *   file.
