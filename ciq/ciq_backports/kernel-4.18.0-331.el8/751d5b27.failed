 +For a formatted device, the target can be created normally with the
 +dmsetup utility. The only parameter that dm-zoned requires is the
 +underlying zoned block device name. Ex::
  
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +	echo "0 `blockdev --getsize ${dev}` zoned ${dev}" | \
 +	dmsetup create dmz-`basename ${dev}`
++=======
+ If two drives are to be used, both devices must be specified, with the
+ regular block device as the first device.
+ 
+ Ex::
+ 
+ 	dmzadm --format /dev/sdxx /dev/sdyy
+ 
+ 
+ Formatted device(s) can be started with the dmzadm utility, too.:
+ 
+ Ex::
+ 
+ 	dmzadm --start /dev/sdxx /dev/sdyy
+ 
+ 
+ Information about the internal layout and current usage of the zones can
+ be obtained with the 'status' callback from dmsetup:
+ 
+ Ex::
+ 
+ 	dmsetup status /dev/dm-X
+ 
+ will return a line
+ 
+ 	0 <size> zoned <nr_zones> zones <nr_unmap_rnd>/<nr_rnd> random <nr_unmap_seq>/<nr_seq> sequential
+ 
+ where <nr_zones> is the total number of zones, <nr_unmap_rnd> is the number
+ of unmapped (ie free) random zones, <nr_rnd> the total number of zones,
+ <nr_unmap_seq> the number of unmapped sequential zones, and <nr_seq> the
+ total number of sequential zones.
+ 
+ Normally the reclaim process will be started once there are less than 50
+ percent free random zones. In order to start the reclaim process manually
+ even before reaching this threshold the 'dmsetup message' function can be
+ used:
+ 
+ Ex::
+ 
+ 	dmsetup message /dev/dm-X 0 reclaim
+ 
+ will start the reclaim process and random zones will be moved to sequential
+ zones.
