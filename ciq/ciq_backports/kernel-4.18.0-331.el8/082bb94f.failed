The rcu_read_lock() is not supposed to lock the kernel_sendmsg() API
since it has the lock_sock() in qrtr_sendmsg() which will sleep. Hence,
fix it by excluding the locking for kernel_sendmsg().

While at it, let's also use radix_tree_deref_retry() to confirm the
validity of the pointer returned by radix_tree_deref_slot() and use
radix_tree_iter_resume() to resume iterating the tree properly before
releasing the lock as suggested by Doug.
