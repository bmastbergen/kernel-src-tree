Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The "select" kconfig keyword provides reverse dependency, however it
doesn't check that selected symbol meets its own dependencies. Usually
"select" is used for non-visible symbols, so instead of trying to keep
dependencies in sync with BNXT ethernet driver, simply "depends on" it,
like Kconfig documentation suggest.

* CONFIG_PCI is already required by BNXT
* CONFIG_NETDEVICES and CONFIG_ETHERNET are needed to chose BNXT
