Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/c7a571b4.failed

If we are currently out of driver tags, we don't want to add a
new flush (without a tag) to the head of the requeue list. We
want to add it to the back, behind the others that are
potentially also waiting for a tag.
