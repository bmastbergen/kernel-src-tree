Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/7c542772.failed

Use kmemdup when some other buffer is immediately copied into allocated
region. It replaces call to allocation followed by memcpy, by a single
call to kmemdup.
