Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

__klp_disable_patch() should never be called when the patch is not
enabled. Let's add the same warning that we have in __klp_enable_patch().

This allows to remove the check when calling klp_pre_unpatch_callback().
It was strange anyway because it repeatedly checked per-patch flag
for each patched object.
