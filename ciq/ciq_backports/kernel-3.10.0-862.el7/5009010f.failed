commit 5009010fbf54bdc27e57baca490e1f9d6a4609e0
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/5009010f.failed

Switch all uverbs_type_attrs_xxxx with DECLARE_UVERBS_OBJECT
macros. This will be later used in order to embed the object
specific methods in the objects as well.
