The option "h" (host order ) exists for ipv4 only.
Remove the h when printing ipv6 addresses.

Lead to the following smatch warning:

drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_iwarp.c:585 qed_iwarp_print_tcp_ramrod()
warn: '%pI6' can only be followed by c
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qed/qed_iwarp.c:1521 qed_iwarp_print_cm_info()
warn: '%pI6' can only be followed by c

Fixes commit 456a584947d5 ("qed: iWARP CM add passive side connect")
