Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/0a78b248.failed

In rt5514_i2c_probe() if the regmap_read(RT5514_VENDOR_ID2) fails then
"val" may be left as uninitialized.  Current code relies on "val" not
being RT5514_DEVICE_ID, but that's potentially unsafe.

Let's check for errors from regmap_read() and also explicitly init the
value do we're not passing a possibly uninitialized int to printk.
