Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/e41b104c.failed

With kASLR enabled, old_addr provided by patch module is being shifted
accrodingly so that the symbol lookups work. To have module relocations
handled properly as well, the same transformation needs to be perfomed
on relocation address information.
