Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Based on 8.4.7.1 section of ACPI 6.1 specification, if the platform
supports CPPC, the _CPC object must exist under all processor objects.
If cpc_desc_ptr pointer is invalid on any CPUs, acpi_get_psd_map()
should return error and CPPC cpufreq driver can not be registered.
