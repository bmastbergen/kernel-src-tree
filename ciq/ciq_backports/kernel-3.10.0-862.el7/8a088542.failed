Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/8a088542.failed

Since PM_INST_CMPL may not provide right counts in all
sampling scenarios in power9 DD1, instead use PM_INST_DISP.
Patch also update generic instruction sampling with the same.
