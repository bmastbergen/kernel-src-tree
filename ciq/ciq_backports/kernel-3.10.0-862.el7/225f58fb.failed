Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/225f58fb.failed

In case of func->state or func->old_addr not having expected values,
we'd rather bail out immediately from klp_disable_func().

This can't really happen with the current codebase, but fix this
anyway in the sake of robustness.
