Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/cf19a8c3.failed

The file /sys/devices/pci000.../sriov_totalvfs is showing a wrong value.
Fix it by calling pci_sriov_set_totalvfs() to set the total number of VFs
available after calculations for the number of PF and VF queues are made.
