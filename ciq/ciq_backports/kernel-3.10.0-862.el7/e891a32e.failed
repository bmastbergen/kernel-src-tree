The disablement of interrupts at KVM_SET_CLOCK/KVM_GET_CLOCK
attempts to disable software suspend from causing "non atomic behaviour" of
the operation:

    Add a helper function to compute the kernel time and convert nanoseconds
    back to CPU specific cycles.  Note that these must not be called in preemptible
    context, as that would mean the kernel could enter software suspend state,
    which would cause non-atomic operation.

However, assume the kernel can enter software suspend at the following 2 points:

        ktime_get_ts(&ts);
1.
						hypothetical_ktime_get_ts(&ts)
        monotonic_to_bootbased(&ts);
2.

monotonic_to_bootbased() should be correct relative to a ktime_get_ts(&ts)
performed after point 1 (that is after resuming from software suspend),
hypothetical_ktime_get_ts()

Therefore it is also correct for the ktime_get_ts(&ts) before point 1,
which is

	ktime_get_ts(&ts) = hypothetical_ktime_get_ts(&ts) + time-to-execute-suspend-code

Note CLOCK_MONOTONIC does not count during suspension.

So remove the irq disablement, which causes the following warning on
-RT kernels:

 With this reasoning, and the -RT bug that the irq disablement causes
 (because spin_lock is now a sleeping lock), remove the IRQ protection as it
 causes:

v2: notice get_kvmclock_ns with the same problem (Pankaj).
v3: remove useless helper function (Pankaj).
