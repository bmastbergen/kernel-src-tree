For flows that involve a vxlan encap action, the vxlan sock
interface may be specified as the outgoing interface. The driver
must resolve the outgoing PF interface used by this socket and
use the dst_fid of the PF in the hwrm_cfa_encap_record_alloc cmd.

Similarily for flows that have a vxlan decap action, the
fid of the incoming PF interface must be used as the src_fid in
the hwrm_cfa_decap_filter_alloc cmd.
