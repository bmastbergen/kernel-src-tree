Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/700a3048.failed

Fix a few typos in the livepatch-sample.c usage example comments and add
some whitespace to make the comments a little more legible.
