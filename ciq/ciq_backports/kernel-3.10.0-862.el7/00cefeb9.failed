Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

On link down, transport is calling driver to abort outstanding ios.
Driver erroneously rejects the abort if the port indicates it isn't
logged in - which will be the case after the link down. Thus, the io
can't clean up. This prevents reconnection at the transport level.

Fix by allowing abort to proceed.
