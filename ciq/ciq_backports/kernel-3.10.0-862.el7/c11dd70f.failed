commit c11dd70fd7f50fca7dc05520ec8075f12d93cb63
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/c11dd70f.failed

Since DPTF has its own folder under ACPI, move this file also there.
