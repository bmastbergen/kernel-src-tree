commit 810ffa4789c8453caf0b876619c428bf64fef304
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/810ffa47.failed

Removed unnecessary bzero of context area. Due to size of sg list, added
a substantial delay and played havoc on cpu caches.
