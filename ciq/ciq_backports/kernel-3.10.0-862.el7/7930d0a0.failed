Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/7930d0a0.failed

For blk-mq, we need to be able to iterate software queues starting
from any queue in a round robin fashion, so introduce this helper.
