While experimenting with changes to the timekeeping code, I
ran into a build error in the liquidio driver:

drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_main.c: In function 'liquidio_ptp_settime':
drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_main.c:1850:22: error: passing argument 1 of 'timespec_to_ns' from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]

The driver had a type mismatch since it was first merged, but
this never caused problems because it is only built on 64-bit
architectures that define timespec and timespec64 to the same
type.

If we ever want to compile-test the driver on 32-bit or change
the way that 64-bit timespec64 is defined, we need to fix it,
so let's just do it now.
