Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/0937e3b0.failed

If registering the function with ftrace has previously succeeded,
unregistering will almost never fail.  Even if it does, it's not a fatal
error.  We can still carry on and disable the klp_func from being used
by removing it from the klp_ops func stack.
