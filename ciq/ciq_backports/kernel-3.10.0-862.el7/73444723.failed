Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/73444723.failed

The "rt5668" codec supported in this driver is actually a revision
of "rt5663". So the patch is renamed to "rt5663 v2"
