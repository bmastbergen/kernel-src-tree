Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/ab1f7095.failed

There is only one clock source in the rt5676, so the chip type is added to
distinguish the setting of the clock source in the VAD function.
