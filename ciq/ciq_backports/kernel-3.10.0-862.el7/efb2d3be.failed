Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/efb2d3be.failed

The kfree() function tests whether its argument is NULL and then
returns immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
