Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/1afd43e0.failed

KVM will have to query these functions, let's add at least the query
capabilities.

PCKMO has RRE format, as bit 16-31 are ignored, we can still use the
existing function. As PCKMO won't touch the cc, let's force it to 0
upfront.
