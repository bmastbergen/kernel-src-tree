locking/refcount: Remove the half-implemented refcount_sub() API

Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/5d6dec6f.failed

CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL=y (correctly) does not provide a refcount_sub(),
which should not be part of proper refcount design patterns.

Remove the erroneous extern and the later !CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL
accidental implementation.
