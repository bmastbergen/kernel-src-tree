commit 1a435111f8eb30b370e3891caebb1d1ca61f41ec
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/1a435111.failed

Make sure the spelled out flag names match the definition. This also
adds a missing hctx state, BLK_MQ_S_START_ON_RUN, and a missing
cmd_flag, __REQ_NOUNMAP.
