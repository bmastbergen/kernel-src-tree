Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/d29d6735.failed

CPPC is enabled only on platforms which support the h/w reduced
ACPI specification, so use the h/w reduced version of the PCCT
consistently when deferencing PCCT contents.
