commit 2e4c85c6edc80fa532b2c7e1eb3597ef4d4bbb8f
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/2e4c85c6.failed

Since there is nothing done with non zero return value, such check is
avoided.
