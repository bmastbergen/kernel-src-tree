commit 383bf44d1a8b18de5c26ec2a48c6822681b50984
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/383bf44d.failed

If anyone includes asm/livepatch.h when CONFIG_LIVEPATCH=n the build
fails with the existing error message. Change it to something saner.
