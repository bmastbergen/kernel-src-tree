Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/191f8960.failed

The compat callback was missing and triggered failures in 32bits
userspace when enabling/disable the perf stream. We don't require any
particular processing here as these ioctls don't take any argument.
