Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/e3246a12.failed

There are several log messages that report abnormal terminations that by
default are marked warn. These are typically the result of failures due
to invalid controller state or abort completions. They are all natural
when a controller resets.

Unfortunately, as they are logged by default, it makes the admin very
concerned.

Convert the messages to Info.
