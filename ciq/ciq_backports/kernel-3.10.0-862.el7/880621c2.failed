Commit 9c7077622dd91 ("packet: make packet_snd fail on len smaller
than l2 header") added validation for the packet size in packet_snd.
This change enforces that every packet needs a header (with at least
hard_header_len bytes) plus a payload with at least one byte. Before
this change the payload was optional.

This fixes PPPoE connections which do not have a "Service" or
"Host-Uniq" configured (which is violating the spec, but is still
widely used in real-world setups). Those are currently failing with the
following message: "pppd: packet size is too short (24 <= 24)"
