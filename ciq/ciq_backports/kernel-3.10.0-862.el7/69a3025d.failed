Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

This driver was OR'ing desired bits from the existing control setting.
That could create an invalid DPC Trigger Enabled configuration if the
platform previously set this to "ERR_FATAL", 01b.  The driver currently
wants to set this to ERR_NONFATAL/ERR_FATAL, 10b, and the logical OR of
this gets 11b, which is reserved.  Fix that by masking off the fields it is
setting.
