nvmem uses regmap_raw_read/write apis to read/write data from providers,
regmap raw apis stopped working with recent kernels which removed raw
accessors on mmio bus. This resulted in broken nvmem for providers
which are based on regmap mmio bus. This issue can be fixed temporarly
by moving to other regmap apis, but we might hit same issue in future.
Moving to interfaces based on read/write callbacks from providers would
be more robust.

This patch removes regmap dependency from nvmem and introduces
read/write callbacks from the providers.

Without this patch nvmem providers like qfprom based on regmap mmio
bus would not work.
