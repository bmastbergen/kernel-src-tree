The ACPI spec defines Minimum Request Turnaround Time(MRTT) and
Maximum Periodic Access Rate(MPAR) to prevent the OSPM from sending
too many requests than the platform can handle. For further details
on these parameters please refer to section 14.1.3 of ACPI 6.0 spec.

This patch includes MRTT/MPAR in deciding if or when a CPPC request
can be sent to the platform to make sure CPPC implementation is
compliant to the spec.
