Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/29bfd55a.failed

The internal cfg flag is actually smaller, by 1 (for a partial page
sge), than the sg list maintained by the driver. Thus the check on sg
segments errored out when it shouldn't have

Ensure the check is +1

Note: having a value that is less than what it really is is bogus.
Correcting it now would be a significant rework. Add this item to the
list to be refactored in the merge with efct.
