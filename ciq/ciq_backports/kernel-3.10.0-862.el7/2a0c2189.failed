Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/2a0c2189.failed

Currently when HP detection procedure runs for certain MCLK
frequencies, when PLL is bypassed, the procedure will incorrectly
report Lineout instead of Headphones due to timing incosistencies.
To avoid this problem, the PLL is temporarily enabled (if currently
bypassed and MCLK present) to provide consistent timings for the
procedure, regardless of MCLK frequency.
