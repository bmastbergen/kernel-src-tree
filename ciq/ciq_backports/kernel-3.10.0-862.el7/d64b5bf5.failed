Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/d64b5bf5.failed

da7219 output (for headset capture) should be set to high-impedance when
not in use, since it will otherwise interfere with output from other
codecs attached to the same DAI.
