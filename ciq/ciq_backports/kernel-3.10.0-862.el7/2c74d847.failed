Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/2c74d847.failed

Computed delivered performance using CPPC feedback counters are in the
CPPC abstract scale, whereas cppc_cpufreq driver operates in KHz scale.
Exposing the CPPC performance capabilities (highest,lowest, nominal,
lowest non-linear) will allow userspace to figure out the conversion
factor from CPPC abstract scale to KHz.

Also rename ctr_wrap_time to wraparound_time so that show_cppc_data()
macro will work with it.
