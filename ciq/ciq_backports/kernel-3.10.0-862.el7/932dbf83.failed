Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/932dbf83.failed

No offload is performed on the XDP_TX ring so we can use the short TX
BDs.  This has the effect of doubling the size of the XDP TX ring so
that it now matches the size of the rx ring by default.
