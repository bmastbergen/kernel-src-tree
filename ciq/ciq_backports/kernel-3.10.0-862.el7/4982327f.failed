Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/4982327f.failed

The key has the same use as the SW_ROTATE_LOCK, but is used on devices
where the state is not tracked by the hardware but has to be handled
in software.
