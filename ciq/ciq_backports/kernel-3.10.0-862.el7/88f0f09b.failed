Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/88f0f09b.failed

We accidentally free a NULL pointer and leak the pointer we want to
free.  Also you can tell from the label name what was intended.  :)
