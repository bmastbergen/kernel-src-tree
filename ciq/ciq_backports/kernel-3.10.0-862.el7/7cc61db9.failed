The PF driver is incorrectly resetting Octeon when the module parameter
"fw_type=none" is there.  "fw_type=none" means the PF should not load any
firmware to the NIC because Octeon is already running preloaded firmware.

Fix it by putting an if (fw_type != none) around the reset code.

Because the Octeon reset is now conditionally gone, when unloading the
driver, conditionally send the RESET_PF command to the firmware who will
then free up PF-related data structures.
