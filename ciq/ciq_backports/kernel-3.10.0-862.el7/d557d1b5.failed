Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/d557d1b5.failed

Now that kref is using the refcount apis, the _GPL markings are getting
exported to places that it previously wasn't.  Now kref.h is GPLv2
licensed, so any non-GPL code using it better be talking to some
lawyers, but changing api markings isn't considered "nice", so let's fix
this up.
