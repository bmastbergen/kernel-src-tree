commit 72f9b089ecd2cc2194d27cbb14fd80a0b1472e89
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/72f9b089.failed

We should report the network header type in the work completion so that
the kernel can infer the right RoCE type headers.
