Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b522ed6e.failed

This patch handles a default IFE type if it's not given by user space
netlink api. The default IFE type will be the registered ethertype by
IEEE for IFE ForCES.
