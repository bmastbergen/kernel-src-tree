When we resize a struct sbitmap_queue, we update the wakeup batch size,
but we don't update the wait count in the struct sbq_wait_states. If we
resized down from a size which could use a bigger batch size, these
counts could be too large and cause us to miss necessary wakeups. To fix
this, update the wait counts when we resize (ensuring some careful
memory ordering so that it's safe w.r.t. concurrent clears).

This also fixes a theoretical issue where two threads could end up
bumping the wait count up by the batch size, which could also
potentially lead to hangs.
