- The spec defines CSR address ranges for indirect ME CSRs. For Each TLV
  chunk in the spec, dump a chunk that includes the spec and the data
  over the defined address range.
- Each indirect CSR has 8 contexts. To read one context, first write the
  context to a specific derived address, read it back, and then read the
  register value.
- For each address, read and dump all 8 contexts in this manner.
