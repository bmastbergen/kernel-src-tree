Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/91eaed0d.failed

Now that the first group will always be the previous domain of this
@cpu this can be simplified.

In fact, writing the code now removed should've been a big clue I was
doing it wrong :/
