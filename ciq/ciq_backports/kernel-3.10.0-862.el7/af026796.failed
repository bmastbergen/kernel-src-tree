Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/af026796.failed

Log a few kernel debug messages at the beginning of the following livepatch
transition functions:

  klp_complete_transition()
  klp_cancel_transition()
  klp_init_transition()
  klp_reverse_transition()

Also update the log notice message in klp_start_transition() for similar
verbiage as the above messages.
