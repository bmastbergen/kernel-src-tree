Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/01c15e93.failed

Previously it was possible to interrupt processing stats updates because
they were handled in a work queue. Interrupting the stats updates could
lead to a situation where we backup the control message queue. This patch
moves the stats update processing out of the work queue to be processed as
soon as hardware sends a request.
