Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/a37244e4.failed

In order to allow for filtering of IO based on some other properties
of the request than direction we allow the bucket function to return
an int.

If the bucket callback returns a negative do no count it in the stats
accumulation.
