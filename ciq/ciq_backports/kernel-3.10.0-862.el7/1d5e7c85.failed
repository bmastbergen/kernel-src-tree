Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/1d5e7c85.failed

As the function ife_tlv_meta_encode is not used by any other module,
unexport it and make it static for the act_ife module.
