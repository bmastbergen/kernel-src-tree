Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/ba856fbd.failed

Should only try to enable/disable the provided mclk, during bias
level changes, if it's not NULL. Also return value of
clk_prepare_enable() should be checked and dealt with accordingly.
