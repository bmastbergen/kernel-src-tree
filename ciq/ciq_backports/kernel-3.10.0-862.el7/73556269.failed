Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/73556269.failed

This uses preprocessor tricks to make sure that a divide by zero
occurs if a struct changes size outside the expected number of
bytes.
