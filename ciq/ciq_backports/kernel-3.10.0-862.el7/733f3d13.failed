Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/733f3d13.failed

Use the device resource management (devm) interfaces so we don't need to
explicitly release resources on failure paths or when the driver is
removed.
