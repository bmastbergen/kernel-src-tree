Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/19205da6.failed

The description of the basic operations was a bit inconsistent
and based on older version of the patchset.

Also the size of the spinlock structure should be allocated
instead of the pointer.
