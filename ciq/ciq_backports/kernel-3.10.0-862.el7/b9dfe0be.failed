Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b9dfe0be.failed

We are aborting a build in case when gcc doesn't support fentry on x86_64
(regs->ip modification can't really reliably work with mcount).

This however breaks allmodconfig for people with older gccs that don't
support -mfentry.

Turn the build-time failure into runtime failure, resulting in the whole
infrastructure not being initialized if CC_USING_FENTRY is unset.
