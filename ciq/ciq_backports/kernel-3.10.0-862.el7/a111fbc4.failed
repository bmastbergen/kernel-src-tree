Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.

Since commit 632c6e4edef1 ("drm/vblank: Fix flip event vblank count")
even drivers that don't implement accurate vblank timestamps will end
up using drm_crtc_accurate_vblank_count(). That leads to a WARN every
time drm_crtc_arm_vblank_event() gets called. The could be as often
as every frame for each active crtc.

Considering drm_crtc_accurate_vblank_count() is never any worse than
the drm_vblank_count() we used previously, let's just skip the WARN
unless DRM_UT_VBL is enabled. That way people won't be bothered by
this unless they're debugging vblank code. And let's also change it
to WARN_ONCE() so that even when you're debugging vblank code you
won't get drowned by constant WARNs.
