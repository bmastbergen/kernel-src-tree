All IRQs owned by the PF and VF drivers share the same nondescript name
"octeon"; this makes it difficult to setup interrupt affinity.

Change the IRQ names to reflect their specific purpose:

    LiquidIO<id>-<func>-<type>-<queue pair num>

Examples:
    LiquidIO0-pf0-rxtx-3
    LiquidIO1-vf1-rxtx-0
    LiquidIO0-pf0-aux

We cannot use netdev->name for naming the IRQs because:

    1.  Early during init, the PF and VF drivers require interrupts to
        send/receive control data from the NIC firmware; so the PF and VF
        must request IRQs long before the netdev struct is registered.

    2.  The IRQ name can only be specified at the time it is requested.
        It cannot be changed after that.
