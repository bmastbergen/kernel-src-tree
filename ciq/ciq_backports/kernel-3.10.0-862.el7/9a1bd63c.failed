Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/9a1bd63c.failed

The list of loaded modules is walked through in
module_kallsyms_on_each_symbol (called by kallsyms_on_each_symbol). The
module_mutex lock should be acquired to prevent potential corruptions
in the list.

This was uncovered with new lockdep asserts in module code introduced by
the commit 0be964be0d45 ("module: Sanitize RCU usage and locking") in
recent next- trees.
