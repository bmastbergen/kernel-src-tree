Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/fa5effe7.failed

Currently the created tc actions list is reversed against the order
set by the user.
Change the actions list order to be the same as was set by the user.

This patch doesn't affect dump actions behavior.
For dumping, action->order parameter is used so the list order doesn't
matter.
