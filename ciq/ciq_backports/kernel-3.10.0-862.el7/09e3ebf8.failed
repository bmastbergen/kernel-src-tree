This adds the DEVICE object. This object supports creating the context
that all objects are created from. Moreover, it supports executing
methods which are related to the device itself, such as QUERY_DEVICE.
This is a singleton object (per file instance).

All standard objects are put in the root structure. This root will later
on be used in drivers as the source for their whole parsing tree.
Later on, when new features are added, these drivers could mix this root
with other customized objects.
