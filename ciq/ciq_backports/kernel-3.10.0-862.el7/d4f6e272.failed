Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/d4f6e272.failed

It acpi_acquire_global_lock() return AE_NOT_CONFIGURED then "glk" isn't
initialized, which, if you got very unlucky, could cause a bug.
