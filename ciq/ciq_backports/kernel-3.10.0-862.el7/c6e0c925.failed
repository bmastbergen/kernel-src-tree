Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/c6e0c925.failed

If the nvmet_fc transport breaks an io into multiple sequences, the
driver will improperly set the relative offset on the 2nd through N
sequences.

Correct by properly formatting the hw cmd so the relative offset is
picked up from the hw cmd.
