Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

codec driver and component driver has duplicated callback functions,
and codec side functions are just copied to component side when
register timing. This was quick-hack, but no longer needed.
This patch moves these functions from codec driver to component driver.
