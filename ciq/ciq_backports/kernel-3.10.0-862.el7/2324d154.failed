Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/2324d154.failed

When CPPC fails to request a PCC channel, the CPC data is freed
and cpc_desc_ptr points to the invalid data.

Avoid this issue by moving the cpc_desc_ptr assignment after the PCC
channel request.
