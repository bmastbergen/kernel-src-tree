Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/e10f9cb2.failed

This is the first step to make the aesni AES-GCM implementation
generic. The current code was written for rfc4106, so it handles
only some specific sizes of associated data.
