We do not have a strict read/write order requirement while accessing
PCC subspace. The only requirement is all access should be committed
before triggering the PCC doorbell to transfer the ownership of PCC
to the platform and this requirement is enforced by the PCC driver.

Profiling on a many core system shows improvement of about 1.8us on
average per freq change request(about 10% improvement on average).
Since these operations are executed while holding the pcc_lock,
reducing this time helps the CPPC implementation to scale much
better as the number of cores increases.
