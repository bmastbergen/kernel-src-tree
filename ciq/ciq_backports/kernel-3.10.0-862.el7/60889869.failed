Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/60889869.failed

Because every call to octeon_flush_iq() has a hardcoded 1 for the
pending_thresh argument, simplify that function by removing that argument.
This avoids one atomic read as well.
