Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/1c1bc6bd.failed

As soon as we've found a matching handle in basic_get(), we can
return it. There's no need to continue walking until the end of
a filter chain, since they are unique anyway.
