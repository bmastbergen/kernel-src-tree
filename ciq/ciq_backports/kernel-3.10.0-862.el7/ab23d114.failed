Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/ab23d114.failed

Add GFX%rc6 and GFXMHz to the column descriptions section
of the turbostat man page.

 -.SH ROW DESCRIPTIONS
 -The system configuration dump (if --quiet is not used) is followed by statistics.  The first row of the statistics labels the content of each column (below).  The second row of statistics is the system summary line.  The system summary line has a '-' in the columns for the Package, Core, and CPU.  The contents of the system summary line depends on the type of column.  Columns that count items (eg. IRQ) show the sum across all CPUs in the system.  Columns that show a percentage show the average across all CPUs in the system.  Columns that dump raw MSR values simply show 0 in the summary.  After the system summary row, each row describes a specific Package/Core/CPU.  Note that if the --cpu parameter is used to limit which specific CPUs are displayed, turbostat will still collect statistics for all CPUs in the system and will still show the system summary for all CPUs in the system.
 -.SH COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS
 +.SH DEFAULT FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
  .nf
 -\fBCore\fP processor core number.  Note that multiple CPUs per core indicate support for Intel(R) Hyper-Threading Technology (HT).
  \fBCPU\fP Linux CPU (logical processor) number.  Yes, it is okay that on many systems the CPUs are not listed in numerical order -- for efficiency reasons, turbostat runs in topology order, so HT siblings appear together.
 -\fBPackage\fP processor package number -- not present on systems with a single processor package.
 -\fBAvg_MHz\fP number of cycles executed divided by time elapsed.  Note that this includes idle-time when 0 instructions are executed.
 -\fBBusy%\fP percent of the measurement interval that the CPU executes instructions, aka. % of time in "C0" state.
 -\fBBzy_MHz\fP average clock rate while the CPU was not idle (ie. in "c0" state).
 +\fBAVG_MHz\fP number of cycles executed divided by time elapsed.
 +\fBBusy%\fP percent of the interval that the CPU retired instructions, aka. % of time in "C0" state.
 +\fBBzy_MHz\fP average clock rate while the CPU was busy (in "c0" state).
  \fBTSC_MHz\fP average MHz that the TSC ran during the entire interval.
 -\fBIRQ\fP The number of interrupts serviced by that CPU during the measurement interval.  The system total line is the sum of interrupts serviced across all CPUs.  turbostat parses /proc/interrupts to generate this summary.
 -\fBSMI\fP The number of System Management Interrupts  serviced CPU during the measurement interval.  While this counter is actually per-CPU, SMI are triggered on all processors, so the number should be the same for all CPUs.
 -\fBC1, C2, C3...\fP The number times Linux requested the C1, C2, C3 idle state during the measurement interval.  The system summary line shows the sum for all CPUs.  These are C-state names as exported in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/name.  While their names are generic, their attributes are processor specific. They the system description section of output shows what MWAIT sub-states they are mapped to on each system.
 -\fBC1%, C2%, C3%\fP The residency percentage that Linux requested C1, C2, C3....  The system summary is the average of all CPUs in the system.  Note that these are software, reflecting what was requested.  The hardware counters reflect what was actually achieved.
 -\fBCPU%c1, CPU%c3, CPU%c6, CPU%c7\fP show the percentage residency in hardware core idle states.  These numbers are from hardware residency counters.
