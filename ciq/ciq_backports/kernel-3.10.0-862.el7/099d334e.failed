Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/099d334e.failed

The implementation of rt5677_pll_calc() has the same logic of rl6231_pll_calc().
The only difference is the lower boundary checking for freq_in.

This patch calls rl6231_pll_calc() instead of open-coded.
The k_bp of struct rt5677_pll_code is always false, thus also remove the
code to check pll_code.k_bp.
