Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/9a54cf46.failed

Issue reproduction procedure:

1. three or more fingers put on Touchpad.
2. release fingers from Touchpad.
3. move the cursor by one finger.
4. the cursor does not move.

Cause:

We do not notify multi fingers state correctly to input subsystem.  For
example, when three fingers release from Touchpad, fingers state is 3 -> 0. It
needs to notify first, second and third finger's releasing state.

Fix this by not breaking out on z axis and move x,y,z input handling
code to the correct place so that it's in fact per-finger.
