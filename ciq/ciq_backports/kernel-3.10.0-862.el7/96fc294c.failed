Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/96fc294c.failed

Da7219 does not trigger interrupt to report jack status
when system boots from warm reset because its power
remains on during warm reset.
Doing software reset at probe to handle this.
