Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/9feb16ae.failed

liquidio driver incorrectly indicates that PTP is supported in 23XX
adapters; this patch fixes that.  PTP is supported in 66XX and 68XX
adapters, and the driver correctly indicates that.
