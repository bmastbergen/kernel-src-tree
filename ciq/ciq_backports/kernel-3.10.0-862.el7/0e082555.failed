Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/0e082555.failed

Index should always be of the same file type as origin, except for
the case of a whiteout index.  A whiteout index should only exist
if all lower aliases have been unlinked, which means that finding
a lower origin on lookup whose index is a whiteout should be treated
as a lookup error.
