Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/4421f8f0.failed

Storage-class specifier 'extern' is redundant in front of the function
declaration. According to the C specification it has the same meaning as
if not present at all. So remove it.
