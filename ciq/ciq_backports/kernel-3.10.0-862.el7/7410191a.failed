Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/7410191a.failed

Remove assignment to ndo_select_queue so that fallback is used for
selecting txq.  Also remove the now-useless function that used to be
assigned to ndo_select_queue.
