Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/92425c40.failed

Smatch warns that:

    drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnxt/bnxt_tc.c:160 bnxt_tc_parse_actions()
    error: uninitialized symbol 'rc'.

"rc" is either uninitialized or set to zero here so we can just remove
the check.
