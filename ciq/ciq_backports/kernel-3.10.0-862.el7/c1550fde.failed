Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/c1550fde.failed

When deleting a queue, clear its corresponding bit in the qmask, vfree its
memory, clear out the pointer that's pointing to it, and decrement the
queue count.
