commit 72ccbbe154fc307c98153725822be515fc0326d3
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/72ccbbe1.failed

Been around for long enough now, hasn't caused any regression test
failures in the past 3 months, so it's time to make it a fully
supported feature.
