Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Fix GPF in octeon_init_droq(); zero the allocated block 'recv_buf_list'.
This prevents a GPF trying to access an invalid 'recv_buf_list[i]' entry
in octeon_droq_destroy_ring_buffers() if init didn't alloc all entries.
