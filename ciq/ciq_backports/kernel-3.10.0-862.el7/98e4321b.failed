Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/98e4321b.failed

The idr_alloc(), idr_remove(), et al. routines all expect IDs to be
signed integers.  Therefore make the genl_family member 'id' signed
too.
