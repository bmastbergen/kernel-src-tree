In case of continous sampling (non-marked), the code currently
sets MMCRA[SDAR_MODE] to 0b01 (Update on TLB miss) for Power9 DD1.

On DD2 and later it copies the sdar_mode value from the event code,
which for most events is 0b00 (No updates).

However we must set a non-zero value for SDAR_MODE when doing
continuous sampling, so honor the event code, unless it's zero, in
which case we use use 0b01 (Update on TLB miss).
