commit a7d2e03928c1936004750c56faf7534c8534f875
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/a7d2e039.failed

There is a chance of a race between arming the CQ and receiving
completions. By reporting CQ missed events any ULPs should poll
again to get the completions.
