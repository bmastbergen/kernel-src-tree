Dmitry reported that he was able to reproduce the WARN_ON_ONCE that
fires in locks_free_lock_context when the flc_posix list isn't empty.

The problem turns out to be that we're basically rebuilding the
file_lock from scratch in fcntl_setlk when we discover that the setlk
has raced with a close. If the l_whence field is SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END,
then we may end up with fl_start and fl_end values that differ from
when the lock was initially set, if the file position or length of the
file has changed in the interim.

Fix this by just reusing the same lock request structure, and simply
override fl_type value with F_UNLCK as appropriate. That ensures that
we really are unlocking the lock that was initially set.

While we're there, make sure that we do pop a WARN_ON_ONCE if the
removal ever fails. Also return -EBADF in this event, since that's
what we would have returned if the close had happened earlier.
