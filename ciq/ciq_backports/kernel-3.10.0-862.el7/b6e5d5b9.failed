Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b6e5d5b9.failed

The reserved vectors at the beginning and the end of the vector space get
cpu_possible_mask assigned as their affinity mask.

All other non-auto affine interrupts get the default irq affinity mask
assigned. Using cpu_possible_mask breaks that rule.

Treat them like any other interrupt and use irq_default_affinity as target
mask.
