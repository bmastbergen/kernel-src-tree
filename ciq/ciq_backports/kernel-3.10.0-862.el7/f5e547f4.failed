Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/f5e547f4.failed

For the consistency model we'll need to know the sizes of the old and
new functions to determine if they're on the stacks of any tasks.
