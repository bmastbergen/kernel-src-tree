Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/ad530a1d.failed

The macro LIO_CMD_WAIT_TM is not specific to the PF driver; it can be used
by the VF driver too, so move its definition from a PF-specific header file
to one that's common to PF and VF.
