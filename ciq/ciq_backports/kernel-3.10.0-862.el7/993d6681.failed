Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/993d6681.failed

The DPC interupt may be executed on a device that is being removed.  Skip
queuing event handling if the status is all 1's, which should be seen only
if the device is not present.
