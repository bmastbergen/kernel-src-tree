Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/8c0f14ea.failed

Allow users to interrupt show operations instead of making a user
space process unkillable if ownership of q->sysfs_lock cannot be
obtained.
