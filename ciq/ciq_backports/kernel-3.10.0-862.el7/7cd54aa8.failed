Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/7cd54aa8.failed

Everytime we need to read ->nr_samples, we should have flushed
the batch first. The non-mq read path also needs to flush the
batch.
