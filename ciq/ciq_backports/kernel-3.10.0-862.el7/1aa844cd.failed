Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/1aa844cd.failed

Sometimes PLL1 stops working if the codec loses power
during suspend (when pow-ldo2 or reset gpio is used).
MX-7Bh(RT5677_PLL1_CTRL2) is cleared and won't be restored
by regcache since it's volatile. MX-7Bh has one status bit
and M code for PLL1. rt5677_set_dai_pll doesn't reconfigure
PLL1 after resume because it thinks the PLL params are not
changed.

This patch clears the cached PLL params at resume so that
rt5677_set_dai_pll can reconfigure the PLL after resume.
