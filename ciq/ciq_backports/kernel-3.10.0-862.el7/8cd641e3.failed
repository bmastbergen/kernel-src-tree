Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/8cd641e3.failed

Which is the equivalent of what we have in regular waitqueues.
I'm not crazy about the name, but this also helps us get both
apis closer -- which iirc comes originally from the -net folks.

We also duplicate the comments for the lockless swait_active(),
from wait.h. Future users will make use of this interface.
