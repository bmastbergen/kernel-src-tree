Sparse reports a below warning.

sound/soc/codecs/da7219.c:804:57: warning: dubious: x & !y

The line includes a condition statement; '(a < b) & !c'. Practically, the
evaluated value of this statement equals to the value of '(a < b) && !c'.
Although, it's not an usual way to use bitwise operations as logical
operations to several conditions.

This commit fixes the bug.
