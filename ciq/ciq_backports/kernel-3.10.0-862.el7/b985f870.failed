Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b985f870.failed

Processing of control messages is not time-critical and future processing
of some messages will require taking the RTNL which is not possible
in a BH handler. It seems simplest to move all control message processing
to a workqueue.
