There's a rare pci_driver.probe failure of the VF driver that's caused by
PF/VF handshake going out of sync.  The culprit is octeon_mbox_write() who
ignores an ack timeout condition; it just keeps unconditionally writing all
elements of mbox_cmd->data[] even when the other side is not ready for
them.  Fix it by making each write of mbox_cmd->data[i] conditional to
having previously received an ack.

Also fix the octeon_mbox_state enum such that each state gets a unique
value.  Also add ULL suffix to numeric literals in macro definitions.
