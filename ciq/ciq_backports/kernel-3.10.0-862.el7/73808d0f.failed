Description of Lowest Perfomance in ACPI 6.1 specification states:
"Lowest Performance is the absolute lowest performance level of
the platform. Selecting a performance level lower than the lowest
nonlinear performance level may actually cause an efficiency penalty,
but should reduce the instantaneous power consumption of the processor.
In traditional terms, this represents the T-state range of performance
levels."

Set the default value of policy->min to Lowest Nonlinear Performance
to avoid any potential efficiency penalty.
