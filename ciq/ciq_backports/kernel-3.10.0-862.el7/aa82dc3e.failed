Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/aa82dc3e.failed

klp_patch_object()'s callers already ensure that the object is loaded,
so its call to klp_is_object_loaded() is unnecessary.

This will also make it possible to move the patching code into a
separate file.
