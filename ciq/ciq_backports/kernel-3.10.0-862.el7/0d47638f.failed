Kirill Shutemov pointed this out to me.

The tip tree currently has commit:

	dfb4a70f2 [x86/cpufeature, x86/mm/pkeys: Add protection keys related CPUID definitions]

whioch added support for two new CPUID bits: X86_FEATURE_PKU and
X86_FEATURE_OSPKE.  But, those bits were mis-merged and put in
cpufeature.h instead of cpufeatures.h.

This didn't cause any breakage *except* it keeps the "ospke" and
"pku" bits from showing up in cpuinfo.

Now cpuinfo has the two new flags:

	flags	: ...  pku ospke

BTW, is it really wise to have cpufeature.h and cpufeatures.h?
It seems like they can only cause confusion and mahem with tab
completion.
