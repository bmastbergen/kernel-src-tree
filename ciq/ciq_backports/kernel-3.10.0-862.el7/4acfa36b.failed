Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/4acfa36b.failed

By default the device latches data on the falling edge of the
BCLK in DSP mode, whereas the expectation for normal BCLK is to
latch on the rising edge. This updates the driver to invert the
BCLK configuration for DSP mode, to align with expected behaviour.
