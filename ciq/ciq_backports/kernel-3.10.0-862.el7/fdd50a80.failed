Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/fdd50a80.failed

Previously Sidetone would operate only when capture to DAI was in
progress, due to DAPM path configuration. There is no reason why
this should not operate without DAI capture, so this patch updates
the DAPM path accordingly.
