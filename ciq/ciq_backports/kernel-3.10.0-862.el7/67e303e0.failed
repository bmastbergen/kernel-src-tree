Improve UDP TX performance by:
* reducing the ring size from 2K to 512
* replacing the numerous streaming DMA allocations for info buffers and
  gather lists with one large consistent DMA allocation per ring

BQL is not effective here.  We reduced the ring size because there is heavy
overhead with dma_map_single every so often.  With iommu=on, dma_map_single
in PF Tx data path was taking longer time (~700usec) for every ~250
packets.  Debugged intel_iommu code, and found that PF driver is utilizing
too many static IO virtual address mapping entries (for gather list entries
and info buffers): about 100K entries for two PF's each using 8 rings.
Also, finding an empty entry (in rbtree of device domain's iova mapping in
kernel) during Tx path becomes a bottleneck every so often; the loop to
find the empty entry goes through over 40K iterations; this is too costly
and was the major overhead.  Overhead is low when this loop quits quickly.
