Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/73827a60.failed

When security_ib_alloc_security fails, qp->qp_sec memory is freed.
However ib_destroy_qp still tries to access this memory which result
in kernel crash. So its initialized to NULL to avoid such access.
