Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/d936d527.failed

To aid PLL in locking on to a 32KHz MCLK, some register mods
are made during PLL configuration, and when enabling the DAI,
to achieve the full range of sample rates.
