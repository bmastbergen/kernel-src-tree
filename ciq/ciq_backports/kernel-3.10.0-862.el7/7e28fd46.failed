Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/7e28fd46.failed

Currently PC counter is always synchronised to DAI which means that
when the DAI is disabled, features such as ALC calibration cannot
be executed successfully. This patch makes sure that when the DAI
is disabled, PC counter is set to free-running.
