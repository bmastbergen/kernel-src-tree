Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/df1421b5.failed

At least Falcon Ridge when in host mode does not have any kind of DROM
available and reading DROM offset returns 0 for these. Do not try to
read DROM any further in that case.
