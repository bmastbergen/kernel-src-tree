Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/164c2924.failed

Non-existent or empty DIMM slots result in error return from
RD_REGP(). But we shouldn't give up on failure.

So long as we find at least one DIMM we can continue.
