Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/8e6a9046.failed

Receive a request when the NFP does not know the next hop for a packet
that is to be encapsulated in a VXLAN tunnel. Do a route lookup, determine
the next hop entry and update neighbour table on NFP. Monitor the kernel
neighbour table for link changes and update NFP with relevant information.
Overwrite routes with zero values on the NFP when they expire.
