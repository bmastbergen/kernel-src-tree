Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/60a8d62b.failed

DMIC clock source is not from codec system clock directly. it is
generated from the division of system clock. And it should be 256 *
sample rate of AIF1.
