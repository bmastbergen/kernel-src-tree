Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/f515c383.failed

rt298_jack_detect may be called before card is instantiated. And
snd_soc_dapm_force_enable_pin will not work in that case. So, update
bit manually by regmap_update_bits.
