Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/77041e89.failed

Presumably we never hit this return, but static checkers complain that
we need to unlock so we may as well fix that.
