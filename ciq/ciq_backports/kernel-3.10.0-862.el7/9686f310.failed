Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/9686f310.failed

The vfree() function performs also input parameter validation.
Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
