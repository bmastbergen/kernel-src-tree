Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/46a41b51.failed

Fix to return a negative error code from the error handling
case instead of 0, as done elsewhere in this function.

While at it, remove redundant input_free_device(NULL) call.
