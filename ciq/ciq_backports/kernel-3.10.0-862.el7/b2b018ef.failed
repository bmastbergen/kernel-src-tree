Currently, patching objects with duplicate symbol names fail because the
creation of the sysfs function directory collides with the previous
attempt. Appending old_addr to the function name is problematic as it
reveals the address of the function being patch to a normal user. Using
the symbol's occurrence in kallsyms to postfix the function name in the
sysfs directory solves the issue of having consistent unique names and
ensuring that the address is not exposed to a normal user.

In addition, using the symbol position as the user's method to disambiguate
symbols instead of addr allows for disambiguating symbols in modules as
well for both function addresses and for relocs. This also simplifies much
of the code. Special handling for kASLR is no longer needed and can be
removed. The klp_find_verify_func_addr function can be replaced by
klp_find_object_symbol, and klp_verify_vmlinux_symbol and its callback can
be removed completely.

In cases of duplicate symbols, old_sympos will be used to disambiguate
instead of old_addr. By default old_sympos will be 0, and patching will
only succeed if the symbol is unique. Specifying a positive value will
ensure that occurrence of the symbol in kallsyms for the patched object
will be used for patching if it is valid.

In addition, make old_addr an internal structure field not to be specified
by the user. Finally, remove klp_find_verify_func_addr as it can be
replaced by klp_find_object_symbol directly.

Support for symbol position disambiguation for relocations is added in the
next patch in this series.
