Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

User space applications in some cases have the need to enforce a
specific port type(DFP/UFP/DRP). This change allows userspace to
attempt setting the desired port type. Low level drivers can
however reject the request if the specific port type is not supported.
