Since commit 3b4477d2dcf2709d0be89e2a8dced3d0f4a017f2 ("VSOCK: use TCP
state constants for sk_state") VSOCK has used TCP_* constants for
sk_state.

Commit b4562ca7925a3bedada87a3dd072dd5bad043288 ("hv_sock: add locking
in the open/close/release code paths") reintroduced the SS_DISCONNECTING
constant.

This patch replaces the old SS_DISCONNECTING with the new TCP_CLOSING
constant.
