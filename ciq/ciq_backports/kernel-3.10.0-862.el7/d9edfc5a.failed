Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/d9edfc5a.failed

Currently, we initialize all fields of ib_uobject straight after
allocation. Therefore, a kmalloc was sufficient. Since ib_uobject
could be embedded in a type specific structure, we nullify it to
spare programmer errors.
