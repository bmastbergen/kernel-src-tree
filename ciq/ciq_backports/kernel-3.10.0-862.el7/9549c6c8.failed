Change to support host<->firmware command return value.
Fix for vf mac addr state command.
1. Added support for firmware commands to return a value:
   - previously, the returned code overlapped with host codes, thus
     commands were only returning 0 (success) or -1 (interpreted as
     timeout)
   - per 'response_manager.h', the error codes are split into two fields
     (major/minor) now, firmware commands are grouped into their own
     'major' group, separate from the host's 'major' group, which allow f/w
     commands to return any 16-bit value
2. The command to set vf mac addr was logging a success message even if
   command failed.  Now command uses a callback function to log the status
   message.
3. The command to set vf mac addr was not logging a message when set via
   the host 'ip' command.  Now, the callback function will log an
   appropriate message.
