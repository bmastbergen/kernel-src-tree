Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/9894dbaf.failed

This structure is only stored in the ops field of a snd_soc_dai_driver
structure. That field is declared const, so snd_soc_dai_ops structures
that have this property can be declared as const also.

Also, make rt5514_aif_dai_ops static, as it is not used outside this
module.
