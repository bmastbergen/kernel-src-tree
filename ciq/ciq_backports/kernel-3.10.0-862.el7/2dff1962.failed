commit 2dff1962242111cc4517119f690587b87573ffc5
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/2dff1962.failed

Now that control message processing occurs in a workqueue rather than a BH
handler MTU updates received from the firmware may be safely processed.
