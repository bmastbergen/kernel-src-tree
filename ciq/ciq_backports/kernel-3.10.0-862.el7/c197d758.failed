Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/c197d758.failed

The desired_perf is an abstract performance number. Its value should
be in the range of [lowest perf, highest perf] of CPPC.
The correct calculation is
  desired_perf = freq * cppc_highest_perf / cppc_dmi_max_khz

And cppc_cpufreq_set_target() returns if desired_perf is exactly
the same with the old perf.
