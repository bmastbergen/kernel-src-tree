Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b72f8051.failed

The vectors_per_node is calculated from the remaining available vectors.
The current vector starts after pre_vectors, so we need to subtract that
from the current to properly account for the number of remaining vectors
to assign.
