commit 01df7f5a77b926c2d790cf66d942d2a68d4ad5de
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/01df7f5a.failed

Since the IB_WC_BIND_MW opcode has been dropped, set the correct
IB WC opcode explicitly.
