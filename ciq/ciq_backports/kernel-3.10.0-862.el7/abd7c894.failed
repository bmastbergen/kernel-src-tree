Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/abd7c894.failed

Initial silicon did not have master bias enabled by default, unlike
later HW, so use regmap patch to align with newer defaults.
