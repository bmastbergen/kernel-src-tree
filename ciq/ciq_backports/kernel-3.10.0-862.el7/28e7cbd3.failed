Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/28e7cbd3.failed

When livepatch tries to patch a function it takes the function address
and asks ftrace to install the livepatch handler at that location.
ftrace will look for an mcount call site at that exact address.

On powerpc the mcount location is not the first instruction of the
function, and in fact it's not at a constant offset from the start of
the function. To accommodate this add a hook which arch code can
override to customise the behaviour.
