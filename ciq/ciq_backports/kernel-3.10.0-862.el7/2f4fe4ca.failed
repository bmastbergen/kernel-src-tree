Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/2f4fe4ca.failed

This includes calling the parsing code that translates from pedit
speak to the HW API, allocation (deallocation) of a modify header
context and setting the modify header id associated with this
context to the FTE of that flow.
