The driver now supports ACPI based initialisation as well as DT
and old pdata methods. However the FW data handling still uses
DT specific calls to read firmware data (of_property*) so for
ACPI based initialisation the FW data will only be set to default
values. This patch updates the FW handling to use device_property*
calls instead so that both ACPI and DT are handled as expected.
