Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/c154e750.failed

that had transitioned to a non active state.

There is no need to print the node pointer address for a node that
is not active the DID should be enough to debug.
