Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/cc47dd68.failed

imm_data is copied directly from the ib_send_wr and ib_wc which have
it marked as __be32, copy that mark into the uapi structures as well.
