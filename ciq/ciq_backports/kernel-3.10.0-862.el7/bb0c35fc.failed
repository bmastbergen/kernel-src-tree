Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/bb0c35fc.failed

Currently if AAD is enabled in the device, during system suspend
the feature remains, regardless of whether the codec is a wake-up
source or not. This means some additional power is being used
which is unnecessary, and can causes issues with some platforms'
IRQ handlers where state changes during system suspend aren't
captured.

This patch updates the driver to disable AAD during suspend, if
we're not a wake-up source, and then re-enables this on resume.
