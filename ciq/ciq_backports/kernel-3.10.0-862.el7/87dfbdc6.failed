The process below was broken and is fixed with this patch.

//add an mirred action and give it an instance id of 1
sudo tc actions add action mirred egress mirror dev $MDEV  index 1
//create a filter which binds to mirred action id 1
sudo tc filter add dev $DEV parent ffff: protocol ip prio 1 u32\
match ip dst 17.0.0.1/32 flowid 1:10 action mirred index 1

Message before bug fix was:
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
We have an error talking to the kernel
