Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/4501fe61.failed

This is to disable/enable DW_DMAC hw during late suspend/early resume.
Since DMA is providing service to other clients (eg: SPI, HSUART),
we need to ensure DMA suspends after the clients and resume
before the clients are active.
