klp_complete_transition() performs a bit of housework before a
transition to KLP_PATCHED or KLP_UNPATCHED is actually completed
(including post-(un)patch callbacks).  To be consistent, move the
transition "complete" kernel log notice out of
klp_try_complete_transition() and into klp_complete_transition().
