Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/4e929134.failed

Currently if bulk_enable() of supplies fails, the code still goes on
to try and put the device into active state, and set expected IO
voltage of the device. This doesn't really make sense so code now
returns on bulk_enable() failure, with an error message. Also,
to help with debug, failure to get supplies also provides an error
message.
