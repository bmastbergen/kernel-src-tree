Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/4e8c8615.failed

The process below was broken and is fixed with this patch.

//add an ife action and give it an instance id of 1
sudo tc actions add action ife encode \
type 0xDEAD allow mark dst 02:15:15:15:15:15 index 1

//create a filter which binds to ife action id 1
sudo tc filter add dev $DEV parent ffff: protocol ip prio 1 u32\
match ip dst 17.0.0.1/32 flowid 1:11 action ife index 1

Message before fix was:
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
We have an error talking to the kernel
