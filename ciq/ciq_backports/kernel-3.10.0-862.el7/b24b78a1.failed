Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b24b78a1.failed

There is an #error in asm/livepatch.h for both x86 and s390 in
!CONFIG_LIVEPATCH cases. It does not make much sense as pointed out by
Michael Ellerman. One can happily include asm/livepatch.h with
CONFIG_LIVEPATCH. Remove it as useless.
