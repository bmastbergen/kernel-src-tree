commit a5461fd6c8f70b3d897f5f76612e890ad47a5b93
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/a5461fd6.failed

Due to the DMIC that needs time to initial after the MCLK is provided, the
field of delay time is implemented by the platform data.
