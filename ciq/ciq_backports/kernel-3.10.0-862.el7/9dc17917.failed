Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/9dc17917.failed

The CPU policy struct indicates the co-ordination type
for all CPUs of a common freq domain. Initialize it
correctly using the CPU specific data gathered from
CPPC ACPI lib via acpi_get_psd_map().

The PSD object is optional, so the cpu->shared_type
can also be 0. So instead of assuming any value other
than SW_ANY(0xFD) is unsupported, explictly check
if shared_type is SW_ALL and then bail.
