Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/e1b8ad8e.failed

According to specifications, HID over I2C devices are not bound to respond to
query for INPUT REPORTS. Thus dropping the call during init as many devices
does not respond causing error messages during boot.
