Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/e7c95eff.failed

The ctr mode of protected key aes uses the ctrblk page if the
ctrblk_lock could be acquired. If the protected key has to be
reestablished and this operation fails the unlock for the
ctrblk_lock is missing. Add it.
