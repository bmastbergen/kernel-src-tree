++=======
+ renaming directories
+ --------------------
+ 
+ When renaming a directory that is on the lower layer or merged (i.e. the
+ directory was not created on the upper layer to start with) overlayfs can
+ handle it in two different ways:
+ 
+ 1. return EXDEV error: this error is returned by rename(2) when trying to
+    move a file or directory across filesystem boundaries.  Hence
+    applications are usually prepared to hande this error (mv(1) for example
+    recursively copies the directory tree).  This is the default behavior.
+ 
+ 2. If the "redirect_dir" feature is enabled, then the directory will be
+    copied up (but not the contents).  Then the "trusted.overlay.redirect"
+    extended attribute is set to the path of the original location from the
+    root of the overlay.  Finally the directory is moved to the new
+    location.
