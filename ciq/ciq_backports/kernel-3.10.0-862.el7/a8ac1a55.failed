Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/a8ac1a55.failed

Reduce the load time of the VF driver by decreasing the wait time between
iterations of the loop that polls for a mailbox response from the PF. Also
change the wait time units from jiffies to milliseconds.
