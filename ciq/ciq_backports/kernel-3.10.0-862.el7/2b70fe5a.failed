Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/2b70fe5a.failed

This action is meant to be passive, i.e. we should not alter
skb->nfct: If nfct is present just leave it alone.

Compile tested only.
