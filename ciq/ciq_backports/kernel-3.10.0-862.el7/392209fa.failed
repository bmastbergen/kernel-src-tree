Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/392209fa.failed

Deprecate the 1-bit flag (bit 2 in the SLI_SCRATCH_1 Octeon register) that
indicates that the liquidio watchdog kernel thread is running for this NIC.
Reason is:  it is incompatible with the firmware's use for SLI_SCRATCH_1.

In lieu of checking that now-deprecated flag, check the value of
oct_dev->adapter_refcount to determine whether or not to create the
watchdog kernel thread.
