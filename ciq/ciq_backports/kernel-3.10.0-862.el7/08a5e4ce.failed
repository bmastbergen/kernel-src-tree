Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/08a5e4ce.failed

The root switch is part of the host controller and cannot be physically
removed, so there is no point of reading UID again on resume in order to
check if the root switch is still the same.
