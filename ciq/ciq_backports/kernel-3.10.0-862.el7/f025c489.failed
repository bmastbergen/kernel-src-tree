Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/f025c489.failed

The only scenario where this function was called while the lock is
already taken is in the context cleanup scenario. Thus, in order not
to pass the lock state to this function, we just call the remove logic
straight from the cleanup context function.
