Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/18d4d7d0.failed

In commit e869b5462f83 ("blk-mq: Unregister debugfs attributes
earlier"), we shuffled the debugfs cleanup around so that the "state"
attribute was removed before we freed the blk-mq data structures.
However, later changes are going to undo that, so we need to explicitly
disallow running a dead queue.
