Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/eb33869c.failed

If the rt5514-spi driver is not enabled in kernel, hotword model will
not be loaded when "DSP Voice Wake Up" is set to turn on DSP mode, and
an error is logged instead.
