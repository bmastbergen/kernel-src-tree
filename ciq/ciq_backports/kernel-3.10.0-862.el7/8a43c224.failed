Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/8a43c224.failed

acpi_device_id are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with acpi_device_id provided by <acpi/acpi_bus.h> work with
const acpi_device_id. So mark the non-const structs as const.
