Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/f7d3daca.failed

For the case of all layers not on the same fs, try to decode the copy up
origin file handle on any of the lower layers.
