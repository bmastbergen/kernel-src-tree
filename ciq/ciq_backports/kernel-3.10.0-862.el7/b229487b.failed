Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b229487b.failed

Remove invalid call to dma_sync_single_for_cpu() because previous DMA
allocation was coherent--not streaming.  Remove code that references fields
in struct list_head; replace it with calls to list_empty() and
list_first_entry().  Also, add comment to clarify complicated if statement.
