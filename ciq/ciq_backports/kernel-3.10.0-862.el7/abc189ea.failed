Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/abc189ea.failed

Current checking for PLL 32KHz mode fails in driver code when
bypassing the PLL. This is due to an incorrect check of PLL
source type when 32KHz clock is provided. Removal of this check
resolves the issue.
