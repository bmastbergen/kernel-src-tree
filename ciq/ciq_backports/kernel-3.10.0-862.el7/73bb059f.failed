The point of sched_group_mask is to select those CPUs from
sched_group_cpus that can actually arrive at this balance domain.

The current code gets it wrong, as can be readily demonstrated with a
topology like:

  node   0   1   2   3
    0:  10  20  30  20
    1:  20  10  20  30
    2:  30  20  10  20
    3:  20  30  20  10

Where (for example) domain 1 on CPU1 ends up with a mask that includes
CPU0:

  [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
  []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
  []   groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
  []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
  []    groups: 0-2 (mask: 0-2) (cpu_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity: 3072)

This causes sched_balance_cpu() to compute the wrong CPU and
consequently should_we_balance() will terminate early resulting in
missed load-balance opportunities.

The fixed topology looks like:

  [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
  []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
  []   groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
  []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
  []    groups: 0-2 (mask: 1) (cpu_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity: 3072)

(note: this relies on OVERLAP domains to always have children, this is
 true because the regular topology domains are still here -- this is
 before degenerate trimming)
