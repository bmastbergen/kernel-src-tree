Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/8cdd043a.failed

klp_for_each_object and klp_for_each_func are now used all over the
code. One need not think what is the proper condition to check in the
for loop now.
