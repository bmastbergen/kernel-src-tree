Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/b95a2d83.failed

Previously we did not check the flow dissector against a list of allowed
and supported flow key dissectors. This patch introduces such a list and
correctly rejects unsupported flow keys.
