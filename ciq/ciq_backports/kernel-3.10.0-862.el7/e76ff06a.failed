commit e76ff06a959336fae64b53c36ec60940ca6ef04f
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-862.el7/e76ff06a.failed

klp_initialized() should return bool but is actually returning
struct kobject * - convert it to a boolean explicitly.
