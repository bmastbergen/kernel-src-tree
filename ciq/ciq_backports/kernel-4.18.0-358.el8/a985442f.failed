Explicitly pass -6 to netcat when the test is using IPv6 to prevent
failures.

Also make sure to pass "-N" to netcat to close the socket after EOF on
the client side, otherwise we would always hit the timeout and the test
would fail.

Without this fix applied:

 TEST: GREv6/v4 - copy file w/ TSO                                   [FAIL]
