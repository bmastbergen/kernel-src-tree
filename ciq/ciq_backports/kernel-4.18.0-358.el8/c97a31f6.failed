Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

If the device has a sfp bus attached, call its
sfp_get_module_eeprom_by_page() function, otherwise use the ethtool op
for the device. This follows how the IOCTL works.
