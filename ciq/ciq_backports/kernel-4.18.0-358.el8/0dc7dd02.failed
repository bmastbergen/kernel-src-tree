Validate the number of bytes to read from the module EEPROM as part of
the netlink policy and remove the corresponding check from the code.

This also makes it possible to query the length range from user space:

 $ genl ctrl policy name ethtool
 ...
 ID: 0x14  policy[32]:attr[3]: type=U32 range:[1,128]
 ...
