commit 493b938a14ed78d7e44c33d1c1e349656a16c360
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/493b938a.failed

Signal values will always be levels so let's be explicit it about it to
make the intent of the code clear.
