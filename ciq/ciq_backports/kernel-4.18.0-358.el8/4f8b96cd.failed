Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/4f8b96cd.failed

kmap_types.h is a misnomer because the old atomic MAP based array does not
exist anymore and the whole indirection of architectures including
kmap_types.h is inconinstent and does not allow to provide guard page
debugging for this misfeature.

Add a common header file which defines the mapping stack size for all
architectures. Will be used when converting architectures over to a
generic kmap_local/atomic implementation.

The array size is chosen with the following constraints in mind:

    - The deepest nest level in one context is 3 according to code
      inspection.

    - The worst case nesting for the upcoming reemptible version would be:

      2 maps in task context and a fault inside
      2 maps in the fault handler
      3 maps in softirq
      2 maps in interrupt

So a total of 16 is sufficient and probably overestimated.
