Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/c49f7ece.failed

The inner parts of certain locks (mutex, rwlocks) changed due to a rework for
RT and non RT code. Most users remain unaffected, but those who fiddle around
in the inner parts need to be updated.

Match the struct names to the new layout.
