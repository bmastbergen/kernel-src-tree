Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/f423c85c.failed

nvme_ns_head_chr_ioctl is always used on multipath nodes, so just call
srcu_read_unlock and consolidate the two unlock paths.
