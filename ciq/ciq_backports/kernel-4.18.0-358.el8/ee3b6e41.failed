Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/ee3b6e41.failed

These stores are copied and pasted from the "if" statements above.
They are dead and while they are not really a bug, they can be
confusing to anyone reading the code as well.  Remove them.
