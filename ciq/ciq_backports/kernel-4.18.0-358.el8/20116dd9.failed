Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/20116dd9.failed

Set "suppress_bind_attrs" to true, so that bind/unbind can be
disabled via sysfs and prevent unbinding ARM_DMC620_PMU drivers
during perf sampling.
