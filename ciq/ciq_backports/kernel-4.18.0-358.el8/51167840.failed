Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/51167840.failed

The GD_NEED_PART_SCAN is set by bdev_check_media_change to initiate
a partition scan while removing a block device. It should be cleared
after blk_drop_paritions because blk_drop_paritions could return
-EBUSY and then the consequence __blkdev_get has no chance to do
delete_partition if GD_NEED_PART_SCAN already cleared.

It causes some problems on some card readers. Ex. Realtek card
reader 0bda:0328 and 0bda:0158. The device node of the partition
will not disappear after the memory card removed. Thus the user
applications can not update the device mapping correctly.
