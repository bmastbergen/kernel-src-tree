Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/46605a27.failed

The command status reply is only for failure. When completing set system
config command, the reply has to be command complete.
