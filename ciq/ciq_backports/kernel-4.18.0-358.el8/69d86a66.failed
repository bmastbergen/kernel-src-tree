Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/69d86a66.failed

Now that the port_groups data is being destroyed and managed by the core
code this restriction is no longer needed. All the ib_port_attrs are
compatible with the core's sysfs lifecycle.

When the main device is destroyed and moved to another namespace the
driver's port sysfs can be created/destroyed as well due to it now being a
simple attribute list.
