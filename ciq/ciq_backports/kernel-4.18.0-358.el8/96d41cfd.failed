Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/96d41cfd.failed

Fix an apparent copy-paste goof in hyperv_features where hcall_page
(which is two pages, so technically just the first page) gets zeroed
twice, and hcall_params gets zeroed none times.
