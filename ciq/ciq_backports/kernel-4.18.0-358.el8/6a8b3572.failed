Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

When the PF is a member of a link aggregate, and the driver
is removed, the process will hang unless we respond to the
NETDEV_UNREGISTER event that is sent to the event_handler
for LAG.

Add a case statement for the ice_lag_event_handler to unlink
the PF from the link aggregate.

Also remove code that was incorrectly applying a dev_hold to
peer_netdevs that were associated with the ice driver.
