commit c03e2fa753020c18f9c0b4017be3f12816039841
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-358.el8/c03e2fa7.failed

Some documentation files received recent changes and are
pointing to wrong places.

Those references can easily fixed with the help of a
script:

	$ ./scripts/documentation-file-ref-check --fix
