sparse was producing warnings of the form:

 sparse: cast truncates bits from constant value (ffff0001 becomes 1)

There is no actual problem here. Using type_min() on an unsigned type
results in an (expected) truncation.

However, there is no need to test an unsigned value against type_min().
The minimum value of an unsigned is obviously 0, and any value cast to
an unsigned type is >= 0, so for unsigneds only type_max() need be tested.

This patch also takes the opportunity to clean up the implementation of
simple_numbers_loop() to use a common pattern for the positive and
negative test.
