Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/e454cf59.failed

This is a simple non-recursive delete operation.  It prunes paths
of empty nodes in the tree, but it does not try to further compress
the tree as nodes are removed.
