Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The sthyi inline assembly misses register r3 within the clobber
list. The sthyi instruction will always write a return code to
register "R2+1", which in this case would be r3. Due to that we may
have register corruption and see host crashes or data corruption
depending on how gcc decided to allocate and use registers during
compile time.
