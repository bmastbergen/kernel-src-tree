This patch adds a test which verifies that the DSCR privilege and
problem state SPR read & write accesses while making sure that the
results are always the same irrespective of which SPR number is being
used.

+ * POWER Data Stream Control Register (DSCR) SPR test
+ *
+ * This test modifies the DSCR value through both the SPR number
+ * based mtspr instruction and then makes sure that the same is
+ * reflected through mfspr instruction using either of the SPR
+ * numbers.
+ *
+ * When using the privilege state SPR, the instructions such as
+ * mfspr or mtspr are priviledged and the kernel emulates them
+ * for us. Instructions using problem state SPR can be exuecuted
+ * directly without any emulation if the HW supports them. Else
+ * they also get emulated by the kernel.
