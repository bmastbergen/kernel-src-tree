commit e349a05dc8faad6b27700383945a1783612cbae6
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/e349a05d.failed

When only the position of a window changes, there's no need to submit
an image update as well.

Will be required to support the overlays, and Volta windows.
