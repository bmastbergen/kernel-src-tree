The eeh subsystem for powernv requires the opal event irqchip to be
initialised prior to initialisation or the following errors are
produced (and eeh doesn't work as expected):

irq: XICS didn't like hwirq-0x9 to VIRQ17 mapping (rc=-22)
pnv_eeh_post_init: Can't request OPAL event interrupt (0)

On powernv eeh is initialised from a subsys_initcall due to a check
for machine_is(powernv) in eeh_init(). This patch increases the
initcall priority of opal_event_init() to an arch_initcall to ensure
the opal event interface is initialised prior to any users of it.
