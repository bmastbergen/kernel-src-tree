Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/9d452184.failed

The DMAengine framework gained support for synchronized transfer
termination. Use the new dmaengine_terminate_sync() function instead of
dmaengine_terminate_all(), this avoids a potential race condition when
disabling the buffer.
