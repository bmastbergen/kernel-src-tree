Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The optimisation it does is broken when the 'new' register value has a
 variable offset and the 'old' was constant.  I broke it with my pointer
 types unification (see Fixes tag below), before which the 'new' value
 would have type PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE_ADJ and would thus not compare equal;
 other changes in that patch mean that its original behaviour (ignore
 min/max values) cannot be restored.
Tests on a sample set of cilium programs show no change in count of
 processed instructions.
