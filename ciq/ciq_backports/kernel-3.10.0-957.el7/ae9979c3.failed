commit ae9979c31007d5366b73640ee7dcbb271357053e
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/ae9979c3.failed

Now that we have a proper API to set the attention data, there is
no point in keeping it in the transport driver.
