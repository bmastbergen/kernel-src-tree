Interrupt moderation for TX traffic requires different profiles than RX
interrupt moderation. The main goal here is to reduce interrupt rate and
allow better payload aggregation by keeping SKBs in the TX queue a bit
longer. Ping-pong behavior would get a profile with a short timer, so
latency wouldn't increase for these scenarios. There might be a slight
degradation in bandwidth for single stream with large message sizes, since
net.ipv4.tcp_limit_output_bytes is limiting the allowed TX traffic, but
with many streams performance is always improved.
