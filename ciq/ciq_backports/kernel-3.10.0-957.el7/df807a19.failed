Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

In the case where skb->ip_summed != CHECKSUM_PARTIAL then cntrl contains
garbage value and this is possibly being bit-wise or'd and stored into
cpl->ctrl1.  Fix this by initializing cntrl to zero.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/crypto/chelsio/chcr_ipsec.c:374:9: warning: The left expression
of the compound assignment is an uninitialized value. The computed value
will also be garbage
