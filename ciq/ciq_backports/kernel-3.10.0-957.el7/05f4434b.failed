Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/05f4434b.failed

mfld_machine was not getting compiled due to missed Makefile changes.
Since no one complained it is safe to assume that it is not being used,
so remove it
