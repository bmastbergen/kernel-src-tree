Two minor cleanups after Dave's recent merge in f8ddadc4db6c
("Merge git://git.kernel.org...") of net into net-next in
order to get the code in line with what was done originally
in the net tree: i) use max() instead of max_t() since both
ranges are u16, ii) don't split the direct access test cases
in the middle with bpf_exit test cases from 390ee7e29fc
("bpf: enforce return code for cgroup-bpf programs").
