Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/1bdec449.failed

Use a simplified is_valid_access() callback when verifier
is used for program analysis by non-host JITs.  This allows
us to teach the verifier about packet start and packet end
offsets for direct packet access.

We can extend the callback as needed but for most packet
processing needs there isn't much more the offloads may
require.
