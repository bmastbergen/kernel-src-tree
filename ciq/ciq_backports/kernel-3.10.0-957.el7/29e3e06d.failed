Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/29e3e06d.failed

Use the ARRAY_SIZE macro in the for loops that access queue->fileio.blocks.
Macro is already used in a couple of places where this access occurs,
but range was hardcoded in these locations.
