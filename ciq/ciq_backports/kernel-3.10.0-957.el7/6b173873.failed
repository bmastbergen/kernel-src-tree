Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/6b173873.failed

When running as parser interpret BPF_LD | BPF_IMM | BPF_DW
instructions as loading CONST_IMM with the value stored
in imm.  The verifier will continue not recognizing those
due to concerns about search space/program complexity
increase.
