Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/976b5a0e.failed

To prepare for SOF integration, we need new fields in the machine table.
It is intended that the same table is used for both closed-source and
open-source firmware to avoid repeating ACPI-related information
multiple times
No functional change
