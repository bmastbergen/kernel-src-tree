Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/a6d5d230.failed

If a port is unregistered, all the devices attached to it
must be unregistered as well. This will also make sure VBUS
and VCONN are disabled.
