commit 1ca0259b18478b2bab6d5c81ca1de52dd519ae5e
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/1ca0259b.failed

There is no need to do the assignment to indio_dev->num_channels in two
lines code.

Put it in one line.
