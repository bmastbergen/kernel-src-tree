Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/9f691549.failed

when htab_elem is removed from the bucket list the htab_elem.hash_node.next
field should not be overridden too early otherwise we have a tiny race window
between lookup and delete.
The bug was discovered by manual code analysis and reproducible
only with explicit udelay() in lookup_elem_raw().
