Commit 4bebdc7a85aa ("bpf: add helper bpf_perf_prog_read_value")
added helper bpf_perf_prog_read_value so that perf_event type program
can read event counter and enabled/running time.
This commit, however, introduced a bug which allows this helper
for tracepoint type programs. This is incorrect as bpf_perf_prog_read_value
needs to access perf_event through its bpf_perf_event_data_kern type context,
which is not available for tracepoint type program.

This patch fixed the issue by separating bpf_func_proto between tracepoint
and perf_event type programs and removed bpf_perf_prog_read_value
from tracepoint func prototype.
