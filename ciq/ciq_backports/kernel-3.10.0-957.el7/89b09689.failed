Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/89b09689.failed

err in bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() still holds 0 at that time from prior
check_uarg_tail_zero() check. Explicitly return -EFAULT instead, so
user space can be notified of buggy behavior.
