Commit e1abf2cc8d5d80b41c4419368ec743ccadbb131e ("bpf: Fix the build on
BPF_SYSCALL=y && !CONFIG_TRACING kernels, make it more configurable")
updated the building condition of bpf_trace.o from CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL
to CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS, but the corresponding #ifdef controller in
trace_events.h for trace_call_bpf() was not changed. Which, in theory,
is incorrect.

With current Kconfigs, we can create a .config with CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y
and CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS=n by unselecting CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENT and
selecting CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL. With these options, trace_call_bpf() will
be defined as an extern function, but if anyone calls it a symbol missing
error will be triggered since bpf_trace.o was not built.

This patch changes the #ifdef controller for trace_call_bpf() from
CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL to CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS. I'll show its correctness:

Before this patch:

   BPF_SYSCALL   BPF_EVENTS   trace_call_bpf   bpf_trace.o
   y             y           normal           compiled
   n             n           inline           not compiled
   y             n           normal           not compiled (incorrect)
   n             y          impossible (BPF_EVENTS depends on BPF_SYSCALL)

After this patch:

   BPF_SYSCALL   BPF_EVENTS   trace_call_bpf   bpf_trace.o
   y             y           normal           compiled
   n             n           inline           not compiled
   y             n           inline           not compiled (fixed)
   n             y          impossible (BPF_EVENTS depends on BPF_SYSCALL)

So this patch doesn't break anything. QED.
