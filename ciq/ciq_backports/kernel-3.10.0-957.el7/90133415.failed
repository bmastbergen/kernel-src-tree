Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/90133415.failed

I've seen two patch proposals now for helper additions that used
ARG_PTR_TO_MEM or similar in reg_X but no corresponding ARG_CONST_SIZE
in reg_X+1. Verifier won't complain in such case, but it will omit
verifying the memory passed to the helper thus ending up badly.
Detect such buggy helper function signature and bail out during
verification rather than finding them through review.
