Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/ea25f914.failed

Prevent indirect stack accesses at non-constant addresses, which would
permit reading and corrupting spilled pointers.
