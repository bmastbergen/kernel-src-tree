The source and sink caps should follow the following rules.
This patch validates whether the src_caps/snk_caps adheres
to it.

6.4.1 Capabilities Message
A Capabilities message (Source Capabilities message or Sink
Capabilities message) shall have at least one Power
Data Object for vSafe5V. The Capabilities message shall also
contain the sending Portâ€™s information followed by up to
6 additional Power Data Objects. Power Data Objects in a
Capabilities message shall be sent in the following order:

1. The vSafe5V Fixed Supply Object shall always be the first object.
2. The remaining Fixed Supply Objects, if present, shall be sent
   in voltage order; lowest to highest.
3. The Battery Supply Objects, if present shall be sent in Minimum
   Voltage order; lowest to highest.
4. The Variable Supply (non-battery) Objects, if present, shall be
   sent in Minimum Voltage order; lowest to highest.

Errors in source/sink_caps of the local port will prevent
the port registration. Whereas, errors in source caps of partner
device would only log them.
