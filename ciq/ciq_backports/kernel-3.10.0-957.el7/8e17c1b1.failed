Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The more detailed value tracking can reduce the effectiveness of pruning
 for some programs.  So, to avoid rejecting previously valid programs, up
 the limit to 128kinsns.  Hopefully we will be able to bring this back
 down later by improving pruning performance.
