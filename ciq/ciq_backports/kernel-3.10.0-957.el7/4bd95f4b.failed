Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/4bd95f4b.failed

Given the limit could potentially get further adjustments in the
future, add it to the log so it becomes obvious what the current
limit is w/o having to check the source first. This may also be
helpful for debugging complexity related issues on kernels that
backport from upstream.
