commit 25789f95a8834d154e5c1f0c9df9a7faedeae98e
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/25789f95.failed

The whole menu depends on X86 so there is no point in repeating this
dependency on individual driver entries.

+ 	---help---
+ 	  This option provides a means to manipulate Isolated Memory Regions.
+ 	  IMRs are a set of registers that define read and write access masks
+ 	  to prohibit certain system agents from accessing memory with 1 KiB
+ 	  granularity.
+ 
+ 	  IMRs make it possible to control read/write access to an address
+ 	  by hardware agents inside the SoC. Read and write masks can be
+ 	  defined for:
+ 		- eSRAM flush
+ 		- Dirty CPU snoop (write only)
+ 		- RMU access
+ 		- PCI Virtual Channel 0/Virtual Channel 1
+ 		- SMM mode
+ 		- Non SMM mode
+ 
+ 	  Quark contains a set of eight IMR registers and makes use of those
+ 	  registers during its bootup process.
