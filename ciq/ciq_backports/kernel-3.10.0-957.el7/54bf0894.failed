Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/54bf0894.failed

We are not registering drivers, but transport devices (AKA sensors), so
let's call them that.

Also let's rename "retval" to "error" in probe() functions as the variables
are used to store error codes.
