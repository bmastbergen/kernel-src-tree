Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/074b5abb.failed

The nldev was implemented by following devlink implementation,
including SET/DEL/NEW commands. However these commands were not
implemented and hence don't need to be exposed.
