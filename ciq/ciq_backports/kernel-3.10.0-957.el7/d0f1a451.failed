Commit 9ef09e35e521 ("bpf: fix possible spectre-v1 in find_and_alloc_map()")
converted find_and_alloc_map() over to use array_index_nospec() to sanitize
map type that user space passes on map creation, and this patch does an
analogous conversion for progs in find_prog_type() as it's also passed from
user space when loading progs as attr->prog_type.
