commit a89842811ea98a0452893d83aac07d0b46854636
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/a8984281.failed

Merge the per priority traffic and pfc groups into one group, because
both groups share the same update_stats() callback which will be
introduced in the upcoming patch.
