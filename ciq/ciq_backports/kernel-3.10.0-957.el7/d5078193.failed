Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/d5078193.failed

With the alc289, the Pin 0x1b is Headphone-Mic, so we should assign
ALC269_FIXUP_DELL4_MIC_NO_PRESENCE rather than
ALC225_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE to it. And this change is suggested
by Kailang of Realtek and is verified on the machine.
