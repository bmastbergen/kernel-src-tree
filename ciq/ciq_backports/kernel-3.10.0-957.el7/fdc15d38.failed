Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/fdc15d38.failed

Make sure that BPF_PROG_TYPE_PERF_EVENT programs only use
preallocated hash maps, since doing memory allocation
in overflow_handler can crash depending on where nmi got triggered.
