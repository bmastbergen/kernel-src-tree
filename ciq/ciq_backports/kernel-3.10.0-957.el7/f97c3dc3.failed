Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/f97c3dc3.failed

When calculating difference between samples, the values
are multiplied by 100. Large values may cause int overflow
when multiplied (usually on first iteration).
Fixed by forcing 100 to be of type unsigned long.
