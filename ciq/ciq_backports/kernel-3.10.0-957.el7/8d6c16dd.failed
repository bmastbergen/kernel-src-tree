Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/8d6c16dd.failed

This exported element needs to be accesible to all drivers using configfs
within IIO.  Previously it was in the sw_trig.h file which only convered one
such usecase.  This also fixes a sparse warning as it is now in a header
that makes sense to include from industrialio-configfs.c
