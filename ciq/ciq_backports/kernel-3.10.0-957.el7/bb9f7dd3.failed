Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/bb9f7dd3.failed

Bump the driver version. Remove the build ID because build IDs do
not make sense for an upstream kernel driver. Keep the driver
version in the module information but do not report it during every
load, unload or probe.
