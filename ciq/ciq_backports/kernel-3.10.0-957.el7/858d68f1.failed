Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/858d68f1.failed

Should have been obvious, only called from bpf() syscall via map_update_elem()
that calls bpf_fd_array_map_update_elem() under RCU read lock and thus this
must also be in GFP_ATOMIC, of course.
