Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/b76354cd.failed

Generally we do a preload before doing idr allocation. This also help
improve the allocation success rate in memory pressure.
