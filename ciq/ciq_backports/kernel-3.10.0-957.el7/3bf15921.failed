Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/3bf15921.failed

verifier knows how to trim paths that are known not to be
taken at run-time when register containing run-time constant
is compared with another constant.
It was done only for JEQ comparison.
Extend it to include JNE as well.
More cases can be added in the future.
