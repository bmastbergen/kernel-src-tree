Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/ff348355.failed

Now that we have the security feature flags we can make the
information displayed in the "meltdown" file more informative.
