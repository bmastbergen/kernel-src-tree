Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/cf140a35.failed

If probe fails, fusb302_debugfs_exit is called making it impossible
to view any logs so use normal dev_err for any error messages during
probe.
