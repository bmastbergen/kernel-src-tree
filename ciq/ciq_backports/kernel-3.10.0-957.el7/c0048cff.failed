Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/c0048cff.failed

This is needed to convert drivers tuntap and virtio_net.

This is a generalization of what is done inside cpumap, which will be
converted later.
