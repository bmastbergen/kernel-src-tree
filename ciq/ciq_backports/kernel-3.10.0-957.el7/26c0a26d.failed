commit 26c0a26d78bc7c2943d55121a32cb85a4594f8ea
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/26c0a26d.failed

So far harmless, but it's confusing and a bug waiting to happen if the
shifts grow larger than 4.
