Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/241a974b.failed

We forgot to set the error code on two error paths which means that we
return ERR_PTR(0) which is NULL.  The caller, find_and_alloc_map(), is
not expecting that and will have a NULL dereference.
