Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/c67678ec.failed

The DbC register set defines an interface for system software
to specify the vendor id and product id for the debug device.
These two values will be presented by the debug device in its
device descriptor idVendor and idProduct fields.

The current used product ID is a place holder. We now have a
valid one. The description strings are changed accordingly.

This patch should be back-ported to kernels as old as v4.12,
that contain the commit aeb9dd1de98c ("usb/early: Add driver
for xhci debug capability").
