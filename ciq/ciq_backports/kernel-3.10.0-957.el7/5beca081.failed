Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/5beca081.failed

Follow-up to 0fd4759c5515 ("bpf: fix pattern matches for direct
packet access") to cover also the remaining data_meta/data matches
in the verifier. The matches are also refactored a bit to simplify
handling of all the cases.
