As a replacement for the wait_on_atomic_t() API provide the
wait_var_event() API.

The wait_var_event() API is based on the very same hashed-waitqueue
idea, but doesn't care about the type (atomic_t) or the specific
condition (atomic_read() == 0). IOW. it's much more widely
applicable/flexible.

It shares all the benefits/disadvantages of a hashed-waitqueue
approach with the existing wait_on_atomic_t/wait_on_bit() APIs.

The API is modeled after the existing wait_event() API, but instead of
taking a wait_queue_head, it takes an address. This addresses is
hashed to obtain a wait_queue_head from the bit_wait_table.

Similar to the wait_event() API, it takes a condition expression as
second argument and will wait until this expression becomes true.

The following are (mostly) identical replacements:

	wait_on_atomic_t(&my_atomic, atomic_t_wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	wake_up_atomic_t(&my_atomic);

	wait_var_event(&my_atomic, !atomic_read(&my_atomic));
	wake_up_var(&my_atomic);

The only difference is that wake_up_var() is an unconditional wakeup
and doesn't check the previously hard-coded (atomic_read() == 0)
condition here. This is of little concequence, since most callers are
already conditional on atomic_dec_and_test() and the ones that are
not, are trivial to make so.
