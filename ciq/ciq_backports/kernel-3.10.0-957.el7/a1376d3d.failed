Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/a1376d3d.failed

Originally the irq_mask member of rmi_function was a pointer. Then it was
switched to being a zero length array. However, the checks for a NULL
pointer where not removed.
