Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/750e0f57.failed

When on a platform if we can't show MPHY and PLL status, don't even bother
to create a debugfs entry as it will fail anyway. In fact unless OEM builds
a special BIOS for test, it will fail on every production system.

This will help to add future platform support where we can't support these
entries.
