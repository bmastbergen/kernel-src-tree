Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/b29c139a.failed

There is no need to repeat "depends on RMI4_CORE" on every bit of RMI4
support, we can guard all of them at once with "if RMI4_CORE".

Also use tabs for F03 indentation.
