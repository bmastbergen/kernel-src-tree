Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/6832a333.failed

We must accumulate into reg->aux_off rather than use a plain assignment.

Add a test for this situation to test_align.
