Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/267469ea.failed

Variables adap, pi and cntrl are assigned but are never read, hence
they are redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up various clang build warnings.
