Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/97489e06.failed

The return from the memmove, memset, memcpy, __memset16, __memset32 and
__memset64 functions are done with "br %r14". These are indirect branches
as well and need to use execute trampolines for CONFIG_EXPOLINE=y.

	Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 4.16
