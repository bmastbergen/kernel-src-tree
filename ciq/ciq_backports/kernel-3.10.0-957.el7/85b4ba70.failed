commit 85b4ba7055d4cf624b6a608125e3d0c57768cc10
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/85b4ba70.failed

The platform_device_id is not modified by the driver and core uses it as
const.
