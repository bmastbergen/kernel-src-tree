Quadrature encoders, such as rotary encoders and linear encoders, are
devices which are capable of encoding the relative position and
direction of motion of a shaft. This patch introduces several IIO
constants for supporting quadrature encoder counter devices.

  IIO_COUNT: Current count (main data provided by the counter device)
  IIO_INDEX: Counter device index value

+ Description:

+ 		The hardware fifo is enabled when the buffer is enabled if the
+ 		current hardware fifo watermark level is set and other current
+ 		device settings allows it (e.g. if a trigger is set that samples
+ 		data differently that the hardware fifo does then hardware fifo
+ 		will not enabled).
+ 		If the hardware fifo is enabled and the level of the hardware
+ 		fifo reaches the hardware fifo watermark level the device will
+ 		flush its hardware fifo to the device buffer. Doing a non
+ 		blocking read on the device when no samples are present in the
+ 		device buffer will also force a flush.
+ 		When the hardware fifo is enabled there is no need to use a
+ 		trigger to use buffer mode since the watermark settings
+ 		guarantees that the hardware fifo is flushed to the device
+ 		buffer.

+ Description:
+ 		Mounting matrix for IIO sensors. This is a rotation matrix which
+ 		informs userspace about sensor chip's placement relative to the
+ 		main hardware it is mounted on.
+ 		Main hardware placement is defined according to the local
+ 		reference frame related to the physical quantity the sensor
+ 		measures.
+ 		Given that the rotation matrix is defined in a board specific
+ 		way (platform data and / or device-tree), the main hardware
+ 		reference frame definition is left to the implementor's choice
+ 		(see below for a magnetometer example).
+ 		Applications should apply this rotation matrix to samples so
+ 		that when main hardware reference frame is aligned onto local
+ 		reference frame, then sensor chip reference frame is also
+ 		perfectly aligned with it.
+ 		Matrix is a 3x3 unitary matrix and typically looks like
+ 		[0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]. Identity matrix
+ 		[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1] means sensor chip and main hardware
+ 		are perfectly aligned with each other.
+ 
+ 		For example, a mounting matrix for a magnetometer sensor informs
+ 		userspace about sensor chip's ORIENTATION relative to the main
+ 		hardware.
+ 		More specifically, main hardware orientation is defined with
+ 		respect to the LOCAL EARTH GEOMAGNETIC REFERENCE FRAME where :
+ 		* Y is in the ground plane and positive towards magnetic North ;
+ 		* X is in the ground plane, perpendicular to the North axis and
+ 		  positive towards the East ;
+ 		* Z is perpendicular to the ground plane and positive upwards.
+ 
+ 		An implementor might consider that for a hand-held device, a
+ 		'natural' orientation would be 'front facing camera at the top'.
+ 		The main hardware reference frame could then be described as :
+ 		* Y is in the plane of the screen and is positive towards the
+ 		  top of the screen ;
+ 		* X is in the plane of the screen, perpendicular to Y axis, and
+ 		  positive towards the right hand side of the screen ;
+ 		* Z is perpendicular to the screen plane and positive out of the
+ 		  screen.
+ 		Another example for a quadrotor UAV might be :
+ 		* Y is in the plane of the propellers and positive towards the
+ 		  front-view camera;
+ 		* X is in the plane of the propellers, perpendicular to Y axis,
+ 		  and positive towards the starboard side of the UAV ;
+ 		* Z is perpendicular to propellers plane and positive upwards.
