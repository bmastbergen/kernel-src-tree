commit 390db010c96091bd3bd0c5d6c0b667d22290ef41
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/390db010.failed

The current comment indicates it's checking for a 32-bit build
environment, but it actually checks for a 64-bit environment. Fix this.
