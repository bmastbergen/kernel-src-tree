Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/e9dade41.failed

those functions should not be used outside of rmi_core.ko.
There is no point in exporting them to the world.

It looks like rmi_read_pdt_entry() should be static too.
