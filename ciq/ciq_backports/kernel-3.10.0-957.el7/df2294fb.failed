Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/df2294fb.failed

Refactor the code to use the recently introduced
DEFINE_DEBUGFS_ATTRIBUTE() macro to eliminate boilerplate code.
Make the absence of DEBUG_FS a non-fatal error.
