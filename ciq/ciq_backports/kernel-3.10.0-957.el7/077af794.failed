commit 077af794d9ab016b52cd3dd90bd8b1709a61710f
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/077af794.failed

The old URL for usb-storage driver help is long gone.  So remove it from
the comments to not confuse people anymore.
