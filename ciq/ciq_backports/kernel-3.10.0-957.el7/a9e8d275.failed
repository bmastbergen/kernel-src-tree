Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/a9e8d275.failed

When the underscan state was changed, atomic-check was triggering a
validation but passing the old underscan values.  This change adds a
somewhat hacky check in dm_update_crtcs_state that will update the
stream if old and newunderscan values are different.
This was causing 4k on Fiji to allow underscan when it wasn't permitted.
