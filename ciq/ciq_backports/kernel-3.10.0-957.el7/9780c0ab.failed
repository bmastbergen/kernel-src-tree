We do export through fdinfo already whether a prog is JITed or not,
given a program load can fail in case of either prog or tail call map
has JITed property, but neither both are JITed or not JITed, we can
facilitate error reporting in loaders like iproute2 through exporting
owner_jited of tail call map. We already do export owner_prog_type
through this facility, so parser can pick up both for comparison.
