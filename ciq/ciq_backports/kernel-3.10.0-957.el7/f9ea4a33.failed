Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/f9ea4a33.failed

Using uname with the processor flag option in some cases can yield 'unknown'
so lets use the machine flag option as it is deterministic. Add a dependency
for all_32 when building on a x86 64 bit host so that both bitnesses are
built in this case.
