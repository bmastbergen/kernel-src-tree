Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/ca027a1c.failed

Scheduling out and in for every FW message can slow us down
unnecessarily.  Our experiments show that even under heavy load
the FW responds to 99.9% messages within 200 us.  Add a short
busy wait before entering the wait queue.
