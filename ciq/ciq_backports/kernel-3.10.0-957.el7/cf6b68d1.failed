Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/cf6b68d1.failed

It is possible to get the fake key press interruption when the codec
do jack detection. We think it's proper to move the key interruption
configuration after jack detection done.
