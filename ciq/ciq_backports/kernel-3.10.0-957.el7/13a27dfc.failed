Advanced JIT compilers and translators may want to use
eBPF verifier as a base for parsers or to perform custom
checks and validations.

Add ability for external users to invoke the verifier
and provide callbacks to be invoked for every intruction
checked.  For now only add most basic callback for
per-instruction pre-interpretation checks is added.  More
advanced users may also like to have per-instruction post
callback and state comparison callback.
