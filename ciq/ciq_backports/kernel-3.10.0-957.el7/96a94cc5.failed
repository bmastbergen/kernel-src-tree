commit 96a94cc5158859943b7e4e72ae69e572815f5413
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/96a94cc5.failed

It took me quite some time to figure out how this was linked,
so in order to save the next person the effort of finding it
add a comment in __bpf_prog_run() that indicates what exactly
determines that a program can access the ctx == skb.
