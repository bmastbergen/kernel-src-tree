Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/32852649.failed

Arraymap was not converted to use bpf_map_init_from_attr()
to avoid merge conflicts with emergency fixes.  Do it now.
