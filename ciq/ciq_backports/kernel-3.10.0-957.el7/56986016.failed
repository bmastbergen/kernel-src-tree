Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/56986016.failed

Add a definition for cpu_show_spectre_v1() to override the generic
version. Currently this just prints "Not affected" or "Vulnerable"
based on the firmware flag.

Although the kernel does have array_index_nospec() in a few places, we
haven't yet audited all the powerpc code to see where it's necessary,
so for now we don't list that as a mitigation.
