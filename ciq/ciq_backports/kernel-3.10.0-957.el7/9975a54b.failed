bpf_prog_size(prog->len) is not the correct length we want to dump
back to user space. The code in bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() uses this
to copy prog->insnsi to user space, but bpf_prog_size(prog->len) also
includes the size of struct bpf_prog itself plus program instructions
and is usually used either in context of accounting or for bpf_prog_alloc()
et al, thus we copy out of bounds in bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd()
potentially. Use the correct bpf_prog_insn_size() instead.
