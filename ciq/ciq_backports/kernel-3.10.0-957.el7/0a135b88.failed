Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/0a135b88.failed

If struct rmi_device_platform_data contains pointers to other struct,
it gets difficult to allocate a fixed size struct and copy it over between
drivers.

Change the pointers into a struct and change the code in rmi4 accordingly.
