Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/3e29d6bb.failed

The map_offset variable is specific to the register and needs to be reset
in the loop. Otherwise, subsequent register's subpacket maps will have
their bits set at the wrong index.
