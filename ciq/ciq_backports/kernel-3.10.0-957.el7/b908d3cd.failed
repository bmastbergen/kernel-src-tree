Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/b908d3cd.failed

The HID implementation of RMI4 provides the data during
the interrupt (in the input report). We need to provide
a way for this transport driver to provide the attention
data while calling an IRQ.

We use a fifo in rmi_core to not lose any incoming event.
