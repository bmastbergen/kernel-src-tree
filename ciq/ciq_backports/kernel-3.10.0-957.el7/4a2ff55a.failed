Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/4a2ff55a.failed

Whenever we set the register to the type CONST_IMM, we currently don't
reset the id to 0. id member is not used in CONST_IMM case, so don't
let it become stale, where pruning won't be able to match later on.
