Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/b6492b09.failed

MODULE_VERSION is useless for in-kernel drivers, so just remove all
usage of it in the rmi4 drivers.  Now that this is gone, the
RMI_DRIVER_VERSION macro was also removed as it was pointless.
