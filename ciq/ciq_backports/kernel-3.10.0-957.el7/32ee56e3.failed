Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/32ee56e3.failed

'channels' is allocated via kmemdup and it is never freed in the
subsequent error paths.

Use 'indio_dev->channels' directly instead, so that we avoid such
memory leak problem.
