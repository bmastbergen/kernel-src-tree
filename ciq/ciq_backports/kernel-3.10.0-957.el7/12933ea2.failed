Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/12933ea2.failed

These were raised by Lukas Wunner as potential DOS attacks against
the system log by passing bad data to sysfs.
