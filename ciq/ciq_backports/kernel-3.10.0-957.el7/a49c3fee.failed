Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/a49c3fee.failed

Make this const as it is only stored in the type field of a device
structure, which is const.
Done using Coccinelle.
