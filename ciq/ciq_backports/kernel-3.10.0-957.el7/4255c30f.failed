The Dell SMBIOS WMI interface will fail for some more complex calls unless
a WMI hotfix has been included.  Most platforms have this fix available in
a maintenance BIOS release.  In the case the driver is loaded on a
platform without this fix, disable the userspace interface.

A hotfix indicator is present in the dell-wmi-descriptor that represents
whether or not more complex calls will work properly.

"Simple" calls such as those used by dell-laptop and dell-wmi will continue
to work properly so dell-smbios-wmi should not be blocked from binding and
being used as the dell-smbios dispatcher.
