Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/8b9528a6.failed

devm_kzalloc will return NULL pointer if no memory was allocated.
This should be checked.  This problem also existed when the driver
was dell-wmi.c.
