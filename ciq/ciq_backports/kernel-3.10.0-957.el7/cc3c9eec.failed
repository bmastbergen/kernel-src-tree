Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-957.el7/cc3c9eec.failed

Some devices export an estimation of the distance the user has covered
since the last reset.

One of this devices is Freescale's MMA9553L
(http://www.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/ref_manual/MMA9553LSWRM.pdf)
that computes the distance based on the stride length and step rate.

Introduce a new channel type DISTANCE to export these values.

  Description:
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +		A read/write property to provide capability to delay reporting of
 +		samples till a timeout is reached. This allows host processors to
 +		sleep, while the sensor is storing samples in its internal fifo.
 +		The maximum timeout in seconds can be specified by setting
 +		hwfifo_timeout.The current delay can be read by reading
 +		hwfifo_timeout. A value of 0 means that there is no timeout.
++=======
+ 		Specifies the chip power mode.
+ 		low_noise: reduce noise level from ADC,
+ 		low_power: enable low current consumption.

+ 		reflectivity of infrared or ultrasound emitted.
+ 		Often these sensors are unit less and as such conversion
+ 		to SI units is not possible.  Where it is, the units should

+ 		values should behave in the same way as a distance, i.e. lower
