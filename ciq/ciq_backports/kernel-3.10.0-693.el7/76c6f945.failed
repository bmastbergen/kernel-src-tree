Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/76c6f945.failed

There will be needed to have switchdev_trans available down in the call
chain, so propagate it instead of trans phase enum. This enum will be
removed anyway. Also, use prepare/commit phase check helpers to get
information about current phase of transaction.
