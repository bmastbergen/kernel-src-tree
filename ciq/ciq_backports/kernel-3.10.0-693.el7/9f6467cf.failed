commit 9f6467cf229a0e8a7580401b07de2a76e4c8618d
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/9f6467cf.failed

No longer used by drivers, as transaction queue with item destructors
takes care of abort phase internally in switchdev code. So kill it.
