Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/cec04a60.failed

Basic house keeping: If there is an error adding the router MAC for this
vlan, removing the just installed VLAN table entry to leave device in same
state as before failure.
