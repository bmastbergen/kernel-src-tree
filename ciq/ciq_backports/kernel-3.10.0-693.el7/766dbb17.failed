commit 766dbb179d41d6337fed2b3ca00caa5845d298ce
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/766dbb17.failed

In case we accepted a queue connection and it failed, we might not
remove the queue from the list until we unload and clean it up.
We should delete it from the queue list on the relevant handler.
