Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/55130287.failed

Currenly, the code that programs the flow actions into the firmware
doesn't check if was actually asked to offload the statistics, fix that.
