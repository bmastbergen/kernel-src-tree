Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/40e64e07.failed

Under extreme conditions this might cause data corruptions. By doing that
we we repost the buffer and then post this buffer for the device to send.
If we happen to use shared receive queues the device might write to the
buffer before it sends it (there is no ordering between send and recv
queues). Without SRQs we probably won't get that if the host doesn't
mis-behave and send more than we allowed it, but relying on that is not
really a good idea.
