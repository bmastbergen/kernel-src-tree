Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/6c7efafd.failed

guest cid is read from config space, therefore it's in little endian
format and is treated as such, annotate it accordingly.
