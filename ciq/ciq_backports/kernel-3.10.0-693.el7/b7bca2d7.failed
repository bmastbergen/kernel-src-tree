Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/b7bca2d7.failed

As dell-laptop has been changed to use dell_smbios_find_token() instead
of directly accessing members of the da_tokens table, the latter can be
marked static.
