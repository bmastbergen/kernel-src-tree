Commit 608c34de0b3d ("perf symbols: Mark if a symbol is idle in the
library") causes idle symbols to vanish from perf script output. That is
because print functions suppress symbols marked as 'idle'.

However, suppression of 'idle' functions is only used by 'perf top' and
'perf top' does not use the print functions.  Consequently that
functionality can simply be removed from the print functions.
