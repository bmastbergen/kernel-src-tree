We only support breakpoint/watchpoint of length 1, 2, 4 and 8. If we can
support other length as well, then user may watch more data with less
number of watchpoints (provided hardware supports it). For example: if we
have to watch only 4th, 5th and 6th byte from a 64 bit aligned address, we
will have to use two slots to implement it currently. One slot will watch a
half word at offset 4 and other a byte at offset 6. If we can have a
watchpoint of length 3 then we can watch it with single slot as well.

ARM64 hardware does support such functionality, therefore adding these new
definitions in generic layer.
