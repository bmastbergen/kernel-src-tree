Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/17f8be7d.failed

We can miss FIB notifications sent between the time the ports were
created and the FIB notification block registered.

Instead of receiving these notifications only when they are replayed for
the FIB notification block during registration, just register the
notification block before the ports are created.
