Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/cb9c1cfc.failed

According to (badf6d47f8a9 "usb: common: rework CONFIG_USB_COMMON logic")
we should select USB_COMMON at Kconfig when usb common stuffs are needed,
but some of Kconfig enties have not followed it, update them.

+ 	  UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) is specification for a commonly used
+ 	  USB 2.0 PHY interface. The ULPI specification defines a standard set
+ 	  of registers that can be used to detect the vendor and product which
+ 	  allows ULPI to be handled as a bus. This module is the driver for that
+ 	  bus.
+ 
+ 	  The ULPI interfaces (the buses) are registered by the drivers for USB
+ 	  controllers which support ULPI register access and have ULPI PHY
+ 	  attached to them. The ULPI PHY drivers themselves are normal PHY
+ 	  drivers.
+ 
+ 	  ULPI PHYs provide often functions such as ADP sensing/probing (OTG
+ 	  protocol) and USB charger detection.
+ 
+ 	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
+ 	  be called ulpi.
