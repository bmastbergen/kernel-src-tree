Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c81aa797.failed

In few places the term "ones-complement sum" was used but the actual
meaning is "the complement of the ones-complement sum".

Also, avoid enclosing long statements with underscore, to ease
readability.
