Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/fd2ecd88.failed

When debugging performance problems, if some issue causes the ntb
hardware to be significantly slower than expected, ntb_perf will
hang requiring a reboot because it only schedules once every 4GB.

Instead, schedule based on jiffies so it will not hang the CPU if
the transfer is slow.
