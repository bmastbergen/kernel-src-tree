Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/dc371700.failed

HW does not understand ETH_P_ALL. So treat this special case differently
and translate to 0/0 key/mask. That will allow HW to match all ethertypes.
