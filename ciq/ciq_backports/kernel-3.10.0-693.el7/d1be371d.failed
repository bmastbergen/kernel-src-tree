Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/d1be371d.failed

Lots of reduntant log info will be printed out during GPU reset,
including accessing untracked mmio register and fence register,
variable disable_warn_untrack is added previously to handle the
situation, but the accessing of fence register is ignored in the
previously patch, so add it back.

Besides, set the variable disable_warn_untrack to the defalut value
after GPU reset is finished.
