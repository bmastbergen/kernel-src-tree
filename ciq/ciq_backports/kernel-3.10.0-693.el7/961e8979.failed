Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/961e8979.failed

Change the function that deletes offloaded TC rule to get
struct mlx5e_tc_flow instance which contains both the flow
handle and flow attributes. This is a cleanup needed for
downstream patches, it doesn't change any functionality.
