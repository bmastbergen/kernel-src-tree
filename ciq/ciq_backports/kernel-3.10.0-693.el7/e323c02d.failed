ACPICA commit 9bb265c2afb9910e46f820d6759648580edabd09

When /Za is specified, headers of some Windows SDKs contain bugs breaking
VC builds, and MSVC9's default SDK is one of such header-buggy library.

In order to solve this issue, many VC developers stop using /Za. However
we've been asked to have this fixed without removing /Za.

In MSVC9 default SDK, this issue can be fixed by restricting <sys/stat.h>
to be the last standard file included by every source file in the projects.
This patch thus moves <sys/stat.h> inclusion to "acapps.h", so that this
issue can be fixed by ensuring that "acapps.h" is always the last standard
file included by all of the ACPICA source files. This is in fact also a
useful cleanup because applications can only include one header (e.x.,
acpidump.h) instead of including acapps.h separately. Lv Zheng.

Except some harmless header inclusion re-ordering, Linux kernel is not
affected by this change.
