commit 907610bfdf1a7f3d173a9593fde70f67d63476d1
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/907610bf.failed

The prints after [k|v][m|z|c]alloc() functions are not needed,
because in case of failure, allocator will print their internal
error prints anyway.
