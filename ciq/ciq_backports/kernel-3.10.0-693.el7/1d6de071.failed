Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/1d6de071.failed

The second call to acpi_remove_notify_handler does not result in panic
or generate error messages, but it is unnecessary and the function
returns with an error. Remove the duplicate call. Correct two improperly
indented lines.
