Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c78c3149.failed

It is normal to flush CQEs if the QP is in error state. Hence there's no
use in printing a message per CQE to dmesg.
