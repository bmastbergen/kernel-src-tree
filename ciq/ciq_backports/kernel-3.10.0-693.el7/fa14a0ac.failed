Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/fa14a0ac.failed

When we initiate queue teardown sequence we call rdma_destroy_qp
which clears cm_id->qp, afterwards we call rdma_destroy_id, but
we might see a rdma_cm event in between with a cleared cm_id->qp
so watch out for that and silently ignore the event because this
means that the queue teardown sequence is in progress.
