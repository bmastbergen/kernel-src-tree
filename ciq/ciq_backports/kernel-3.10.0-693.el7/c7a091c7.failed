Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c7a091c7.failed

The PCIe host controller found on Tegra X1 is very similar to its
predecessor on Tegra K1. A bug was introduced in the new revision that
is worked around by always enabling the performance counter, otherwise
accesses to configuration space will block for a number of seconds.
