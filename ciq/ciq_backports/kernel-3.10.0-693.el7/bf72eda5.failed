Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/bf72eda5.failed

Sync with changes made by commit 730c9eeca980 ("autofs4: improve
parameter usage") which introduced an union for various ioctl commands
instead of having statically named arg1,2.

This commit simply replaces arg1,2 with the corresponding fields without
changing semantics.

  with close(2) so any open descriptors will also be closed at process exit.
