Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/9372e6fe.failed

Rather than hoping for good behavior by marking some elements
internal, enforce it by making the entire structure private and
creating an accessor function for the one useful external field.
