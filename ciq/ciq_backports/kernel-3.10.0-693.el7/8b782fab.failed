Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/8b782fab.failed

There is no need for the upstream and downstream addresses to be different
for the NTB configs. Go to using a single set of address. It is still
possible to configure them differently using module parameter override
however.
