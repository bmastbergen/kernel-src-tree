Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Current code didn't modify the QP state to error because it queried the
QP state as a bitmap while it isn't. So the code never got executed.
This patch fixes this and queries for each QP state respectively and not
at once via a bitmask.
