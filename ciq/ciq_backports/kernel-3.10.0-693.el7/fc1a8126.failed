Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/fc1a8126.failed

The patch was munged on commit to re-order these tests resulting in
excessive warnings when trying to do device assignment.  Return to
original ordering: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/15/769
