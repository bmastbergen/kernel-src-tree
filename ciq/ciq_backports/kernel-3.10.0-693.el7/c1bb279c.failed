Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c1bb279c.failed

As explained in the previous commits, we need to process FIB entries
addition / deletion events in FIFO order or otherwise we can have a
mismatch between the kernel's FIB table and the device's.

Create an ordered workqueue for rocker to which these work items will be
submitted to.
