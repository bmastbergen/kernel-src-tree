commit 98096d8a787f05b1afe3869aa01e84981915c81d
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/98096d8a.failed

Without this we'll get a use after free after connecting two controller
using the same hostnqn and then disconnecting one of them.
