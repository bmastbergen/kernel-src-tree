Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/519d1052.failed

When encapsulation field is set, mark it as used key for the flow
dissector. This will be used by offloading drivers.
