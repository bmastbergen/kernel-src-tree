Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/339ba878.failed

The current flower implementation checks the mask range and set all the
keys included in that range as "used_keys", even if a specific key in
the range has a zero mask.

This behavior can cause a false positive return value of
dissector_uses_key function and unnecessary dissection in
__skb_flow_dissect.

This patch checks explicitly the mask of each key and "used_keys" will
be set accordingly.
