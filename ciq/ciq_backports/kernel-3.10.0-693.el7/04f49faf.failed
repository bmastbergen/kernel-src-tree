Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/04f49faf.failed

In hast to fix some sparse warning, I hard-coded a fix-sized array on the stack
which is probably too big for kernel standards.  Fix this by converting array
to dynamic allocation.
