Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/1cb1860d.failed

iq is unsigned, so the error check for iq < 0 has no effect so errors
can slip past this check.  Fix this by making iq signed and also
get_filter_steerq return a signed int so a -ve error can be returned.
