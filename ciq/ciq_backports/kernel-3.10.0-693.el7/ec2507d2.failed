Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ec2507d2.failed

Fix several error paths in matchall:
 - Release reference to actions in case the hardware fails offloading
   (relevant to skip_sw only)
 - Fix error path in case tcf_exts initialization/validation fail
