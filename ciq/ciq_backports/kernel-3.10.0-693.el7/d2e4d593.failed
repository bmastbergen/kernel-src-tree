Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/d2e4d593.failed

The newly added nft_range_eval() function handles the two possible
nft range operations, but as the compiler warning points out,
any unexpected value would lead to the 'mismatch' variable being
used without being initialized:

net/netfilter/nft_range.c: In function 'nft_range_eval':
net/netfilter/nft_range.c:45:5: error: 'mismatch' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This removes the variable in question and instead moves the
condition into the switch itself, which is potentially more
efficient than adding a bogus 'default' clause as in my
first approach, and is nicer than using the 'uninitialized_var'
macro.
