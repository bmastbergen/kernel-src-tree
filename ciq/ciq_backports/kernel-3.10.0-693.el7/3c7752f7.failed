commit 3c7752f7ab6d591d07f0851321d6ab1ace46e6fb
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/3c7752f7.failed

We've decided not to access kernel source files because changes there
could break the tooling side, this is one more step in that direction.
