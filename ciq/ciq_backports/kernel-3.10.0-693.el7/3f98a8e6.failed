Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/3f98a8e6.failed

If device flags ingress packet as "fwd offload", mark the
skb->offlaod_fwd_mark using the ingress port's dev->offlaod_fwd_mark.  This
will be the hint to the kernel that this packet has already been forwarded
by device to egress ports matching skb->offlaod_fwd_mark.

For rocker, derive port dev->offlaod_fwd_mark based on device switch ID and
port ifindex.  If port is bridged, use the bridge ifindex rather than the
port ifindex.
