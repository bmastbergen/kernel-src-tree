Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ff865123.failed

Some BIOSes unconditionally send an ACPI notification to RBTN when the
system is resuming from suspend. This makes dell-rbtn send an input
event to userspace as if a function key was pressed. Prevent this by
ignoring all the notifications received while the device is suspended.
