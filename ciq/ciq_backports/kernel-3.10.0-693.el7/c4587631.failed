Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c4587631.failed

local_addr.svm_cid is host cid. We should check guest cid instead,
which is remote_addr.svm_cid. Otherwise we end up resetting all
connections to all guests.
