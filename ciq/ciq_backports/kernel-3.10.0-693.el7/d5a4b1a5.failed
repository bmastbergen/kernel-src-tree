Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/d5a4b1a5.failed

Avoid breaking cross-compiled ACPI tools builds by rearranging the
handling of kernel header files.

This patch also contains OUTPUT/srctree cleanups in order to make above fix
working for various build environments.
