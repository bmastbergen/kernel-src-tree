commit 865cea40b69741c3da2574176876463233b2b67c
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/865cea40.failed

If the user is requesting us to change the QP state to the same state
that it is already in, return success instead of failure.
