Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/4f1b50c3.failed

Kernel zero day testing warned about address space confusion.  A virtual
iomem address was used where a physical address is expected.  The
offending functions implement an optional part of the api, so they are
removed.  They can be added later, after testing.
