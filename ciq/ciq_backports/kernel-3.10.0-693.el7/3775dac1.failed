Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/3775dac1.failed

We accidentally deleted two tabs from the first line, but even with that
fixed the conditions were not really kernel style.  Put the && at the
end of the line so we can align the condition clauses.  Also add spaces
around the "+" operator.
