commit 37f69f43fb5aba4288d38ea32bbe0dfdb412c763
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/37f69f43.failed

It might be possible for all of a QP's references to be dropped
while one of that QP's tasklets is running.

For example, the completer might run during QP destroy.
If qp->valid is false, it will drop all of the packets on
the resp_pkts list, potentially removing the last reference.
Then it tries to advance the SQ consumer pointer. If the
SQ's buffer has already been destroyed, the system will
panic.

To be safe, hold a reference on the QP for the duration
of each tasklet.
