Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/e6cedfea.failed

add a whitelist to check the content of force-nonpriv registers

v3:
per He Min's comment, modify in_whitelist()'s return type to bool, and use
negative value as the return value for failure for force_nonpriv_write().

v2:
1. split a big patch into two smaller ones per zhenyu's comment.
this patch is the mmio handling part for force-nopriv registers

2. per zhenyu's comment, combine all non-priv registers into a single
MMIO_DFH entry
