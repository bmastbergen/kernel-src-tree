Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/1a8ee6f2.failed

While adding actual offloading support to the new switchdev mode, we didn't
change the setup of the send-to-vport rules to put them in the slow path
table, fix that.
