Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/28b89118.failed

The host is allowed to issue identify as many times
as it wants, we need to stay consistent when reporting
the serial number for a given controller.
