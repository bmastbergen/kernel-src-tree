Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/0b857b44.failed

Zero out the full nvme_rdma_cm_req structure before sending it.
Otherwise we end up leaking kernel memory in the reserved field, which
might break forward compatibility in the future.
