Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/45aa56cd.failed

This is the same as the original workaround from S3 but for S4.  Without
this workaround, a rfkill event will be received and it will toggle
wireless devices when radio hotkey is not pressed.
