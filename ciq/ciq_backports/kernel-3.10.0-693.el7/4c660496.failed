Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/4c660496.failed

We'll need more info from rocker_port than just pport when we age out fdb
entries, so store rocker_port rather than pport in each fdb entry.
