Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/cdc08982.failed

schedule_timeout_* takes a timeout in jiffies but the code currently is
passing in a constant which makes this timeout HZ dependent, so pass it
through msecs_to_jiffies() to fix this up.
