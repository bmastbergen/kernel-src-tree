Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/7c3a23b8.failed

The check to see if ret is non-zero and return this rather than count
is redundant in two occassions.  It is redundant because prior to this
check, the return code ret is already checked for a non-zero error
return value and we return from the function at that point.
