Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a16a8ee7.failed

Currently ndo_bridge_setlink and ndo_bridge_dellink handlers point
to the default switchdev handlers

This follows my bonding driver changes.

I have only compile tested this patch. However similar
bonding code has been tested.
