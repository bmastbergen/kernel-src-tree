Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/23a8ed4a.failed

We only need to call delete_ctrl once, so given that both
keep-alive timeout and any other fatal error can trigger it,
just make sure we only call delete_ctrl once.
