Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c415f704.failed

On ConnectX5 the wqe inline mode is "none" and hence the FW
reports MLX5_CAP_INLINE_MODE_NOT_REQUIRED.

Fix our devlink callbacks to deal with that on get and set.

Also fix the tc flow parsing code not to fail anything when
inline isn't required.
