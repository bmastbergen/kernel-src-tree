Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c42831c8.failed

An SMBIOS buffer pointer does not need to be returned by
dell_smbios_send_request(), because SMBIOS call results are stored in
the buffer exported by the module.
