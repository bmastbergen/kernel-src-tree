Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ae3907ec.failed

The only purpose of passing this parameter is to check for
prepare phase. The only reason for a failure in that state is if
TLVs don't fit into descriptor. That is highly unlikely and if that
happens, it is a driver bug. So remove this parameter from
rocker_cmd_exec, and check for prepare phase in caller.
