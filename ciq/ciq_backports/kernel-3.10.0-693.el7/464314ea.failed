commit 464314ea6c119ebc22ee78453e63814453c31611
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/464314ea.failed

This allows us to recurse over all the ports, skipping over unsupporting
ports.  Without the change, the recursion would stop at first unsupported
port.
