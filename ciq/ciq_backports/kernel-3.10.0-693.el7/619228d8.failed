Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/619228d8.failed

Currently if txq_info->uldtxq cannot be allocated then
txq_info->txq is being kfree'd (which is redundant because it
is NULL) instead of txq_info. Fix this by instead kfree'ing
txq_info.
