Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/20a1ea67.failed

Reflect the administative link changes done on the VF representor to the
VF e-switch vport. This means that doing ip link set down/up commands on
the VF rep will modify the e-switch vport state which in turn will make
proper VF drivers to set their carrier accordingly.
