Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/de9aef5e.failed

This table summarizes the information of fixed MTRRs and introduce some APIs
to abstract its operation which helps us to clean up the code and will be
used in later patches
