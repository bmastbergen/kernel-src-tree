Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/040587af.failed

When matching on the ICMPv6 code ICMPV6_CODE rather than
ICMPV4_CODE attributes should be used.

This corrects what appears to be a typo.

Sample usage:

tc qdisc add dev eth0 ingress
tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ipv6 parent ffff: flower \
	indev eth0 ip_proto icmpv6 type 128 code 0 action drop

Without this change the code parameter above is effectively ignored.
