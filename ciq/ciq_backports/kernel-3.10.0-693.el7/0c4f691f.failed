Just before queuing skb for xmit on port, check if skb has been marked by
switchdev port driver as already fordwarded by device.  If so, drop skb.  A
non-zero skb->offload_fwd_mark field is set by the switchdev port
driver/device on ingress to indicate the skb has already been forwarded by
the device to egress ports with matching dev->skb_mark.  The switchdev port
driver would assign a non-zero dev->offload_skb_mark for each device port
netdev during registration, for example.
