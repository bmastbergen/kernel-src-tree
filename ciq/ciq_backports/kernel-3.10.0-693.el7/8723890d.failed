commit 8723890d1d5d9216634ed662e55ee5bdacbe1ac7
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/8723890d.failed

This format seems to have been taken from device mapper header, but
autofs has no such file:function in both kernel and userspace.
