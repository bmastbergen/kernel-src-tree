Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/e8b69a51.failed

We want the size of the struct, not of a pointer to it. To be future
proof, just dereference the pointer to get the desired type.
