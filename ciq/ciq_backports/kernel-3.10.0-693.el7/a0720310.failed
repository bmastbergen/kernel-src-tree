Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a0720310.failed

The ports array is filled in as ports are probed, but if probing doesn't
finish, we need to stop only those ports that where probed successfully.
Check the ports array for NULL to skip un-probed ports when stopping.
