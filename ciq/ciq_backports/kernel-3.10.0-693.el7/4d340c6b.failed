Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/4d340c6b.failed

On the XPS 13 9350, the dell-rbtn mechanism has a new device id, and
the DSDT turns it off if a new enough _OSI is supported.  Add a
comment about why we don't bother supporting it.
