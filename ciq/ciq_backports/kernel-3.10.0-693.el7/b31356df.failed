+ 
+ config BLK_DEV_NVME_SCSI
+ 	bool "SCSI emulation for NVMe device nodes"
+ 	depends on NVME_CORE
+ 	---help---
+ 	  This adds support for the SG_IO ioctl on the NVMe character
+ 	  and block devices nodes, as well as a translation for a small
+ 	  number of selected SCSI commands to NVMe commands to the NVMe
+ 	  driver.  If you don't know what this means you probably want
+ 	  to say N here, unless you run a distro that abuses the SCSI
+ 	  emulation to provide stable device names for mount by id, like
+ 	  some OpenSuSE and SLES versions.
