Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a6e16931.failed

Check if the returned device from tcf_exts_get_dev function supports tc
offload and in case the rule can't be offloaded, set the filter hw_dev
parameter to the original device given by the user.

The filter hw_device parameter should always be set by fl_hw_replace_filter
function, since this pointer is used by dump stats and destroy
filter for each flower rule (offloaded or not).
