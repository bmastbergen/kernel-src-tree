Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/eb523f42.failed

The current code use the encapsulation key id value as the mask of that
parameter which is wrong. Fix that by using a full mask.
