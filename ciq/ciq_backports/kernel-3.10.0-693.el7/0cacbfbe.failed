Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/0cacbfbe.failed

The KASLR location-choosing logic needs to avoid the setup_data
list memory areas as well. Without this, it would be possible to
have the ASLR position stomp on the memory, ultimately causing
the boot to fail.
