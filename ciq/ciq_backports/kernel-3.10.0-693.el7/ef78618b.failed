Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ef78618b.failed

Since mlx5 has also the NONE e-switch mode, we must translate from mlx5
mode to devlink mode on the devlink eswitch mode get call, do that.

While here, remove the mlx5_ prefix from the static function helpers
that deal with the mode to comply with the rest of the code.
