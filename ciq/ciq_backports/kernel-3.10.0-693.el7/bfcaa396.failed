In order to more successfully script with ntb_tool it's useful to
have a link file to check the link status so that the script
doesn't use the other files until the link is up.

This commit adds a 'link' file to the debugfs directory which reads
boolean (Y or N) depending on the link status. Writing to the file
change the link state using ntb_link_enable or ntb_link_disable.

A 'link_event' file is also provided so an application can block until
the link changes to the desired state. If the user writes a 1, it will
block until the link is up. If the user writes a 0, it will block until
the link is down.
