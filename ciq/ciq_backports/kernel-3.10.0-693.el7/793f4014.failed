Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/793f4014.failed

Introduce infrastructure which will be used internally to defer ops.
Note that the deferred ops are queued up and either are processed by
scheduled work or explicitly by user calling deferred_process function.
