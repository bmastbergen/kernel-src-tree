Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/9d2d01a0.failed

All the extents of a dax-device must match the alignment of the region.
Otherwise, we are unable to guarantee fault semantics of a given page
size.  The region must be self-consistent itself as well.
