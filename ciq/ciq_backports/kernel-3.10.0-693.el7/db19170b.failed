Implement the phys_port_name operation. Port names are pulled from the
rocker hardware model in qemu and default to the qemu name + port id.
e.g.,

sw1p1: flags=4098<BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        ether 52:54:00:12:35:01  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

where 'sw1' comes from the qemu command line -device rocker,name=sw1, and
'p1' is port 1.

Patch is adapted from Scott's phys_port_id patch.
