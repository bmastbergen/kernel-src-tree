Ultimately, the da_tokens table should not be exported from dell-smbios.
Currently, in some cases, dell-laptop accesses that table's members
directly, so implement a new function, dell_smbios_find_token(), which
returns a pointer to an entry inside the da_tokens table with the given
token ID (or NULL if it is not found).
