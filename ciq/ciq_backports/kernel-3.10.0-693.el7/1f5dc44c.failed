Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/1f5dc44c.failed

There were a few review comments on the switchdev.txt documentation that
didn't get included with the Spring Cleanup series, so include them now.
