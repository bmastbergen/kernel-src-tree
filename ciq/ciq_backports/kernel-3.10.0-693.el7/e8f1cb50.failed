qed*: Update to dual-license

jira LE-1907
Rebuild_History Non-Buildable kernel-3.10.0-693.el7
commit-author Mintz, Yuval <Yuval.Mintz@cavium.com>
commit e8f1cb507d01205e03f69809af4347ed8ec9db5b
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/e8f1cb50.failed

Since the submission of the qedr driver, there's inconsistency
in the licensing of the various qed/qede files - some are GPLv2
and some are dual-license.
Since qedr requires dual-license and it's dependent on both,
we're updating the licensing of all qed/qede source files.
