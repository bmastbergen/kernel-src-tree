Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/af69f51e.failed

Shorten the prefix of the file operations to distinguish them from
operations on the struct device associated with the dax_dev.
