Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/7c28135c.failed

The guest VM may initialize the whole GTT table during boot up,
so the warning msg in emulate_gtt_mmio_write is not necessary, it is
the expected behavior and it may confuse the user if error msg is
printed out, so remove the msg from emulate_gtt_mmio_write(),
