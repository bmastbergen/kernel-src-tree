Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/61e9e7e4.failed

Bamboo Pads are using the generic processing but their report descriptors
differ from the ISDv* line. The pen fields are marked with the .physical
as Digitizer_Pen, which makes also sense.

Add this field to the checks and enable for free Bamboo Pads.
