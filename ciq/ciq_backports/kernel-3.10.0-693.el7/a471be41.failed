Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a471be41.failed

The entry is touched once when created, and touched again for each update.
The touched time is used to calculate FDB entry age.
