When trying to do interface down or changing interface configuration
under heavy traffic, some of the adaptive moderation corner cases can
occur and leave a WARN_ONCE call trace in the kernel log.

Those WARN_ONCE are meant for debug only, and should have been inserted
only under debug. We avoid such call traces by removing those WARN_ONCE.
