Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/11ce2ba3.failed

Since "rocker.c" is going to be split into multiple files, start with
renaming original "rocker.c" file to "rocker_main.c". Multiple code
parts are going to be cut from "rocker_main.c" later on.

Fix couple of checkpatch issues on the way.
