Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ebd84d72.failed

The kref in dax_dev can be made redundant if the final put_device() on
the device associated with the dax_dev frees the dax_dev.  This can be
accomplished by embedding a struct device in struct dax_dev, open coding
device_create() and specifying a custom release method.
