commit 8fbb89c6fbfd1cda9ae413cd1e042837a8edbdeb
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/8fbb89c6.failed

Switchdev has been around for quite a while now, putting "EXPERIMENTAL"
in the description is no longer accurate, drop it.
