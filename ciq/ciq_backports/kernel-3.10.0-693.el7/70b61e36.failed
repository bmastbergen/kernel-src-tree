Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/70b61e36.failed

When building with the Gold linker, the .bss and .brk areas of vmlinux
are shown as consecutive instead of having the same file offset. Allow
for either state, as long as things add up correctly.
