In order to make the interface closer to the raw NTB API, this commit
changes memory windows so they are not initialized on link up.
Instead, the 'peer_trans*' debugfs files are introduced. When read,
they return information provided by ntb_mw_get_range. When written,
they create a buffer and initialize the memory window. The
value written is taken as the requested size of the buffer (which
is then rounded for alignment). Writing a value of zero frees the buffer
and tears down the memory window translation. The 'peer_mw*' file is
only created once the memory window translation is setup by the user.

Additionally, it was noticed that the read and write functions for the
'peer_mw*' files should have checked for a NULL pointer.
