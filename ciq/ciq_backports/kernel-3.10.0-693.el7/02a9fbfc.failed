Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Neigh update event handler runs in a context where we can't sleep, so mark
processing in driver with ROCKER_OP_FLAG_NOWAIT.  NOWAIT will use
GFP_ATOMIC for allocations and will queue cmds to the device's cmd ring but
will not wait (sleep) for cmd response back from device.
