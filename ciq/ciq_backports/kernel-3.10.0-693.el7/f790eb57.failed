Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/f790eb57.failed

Use an explicit module softdep rather than a request module call such
that the dependency is exposed to userspace.  This allows us to more
easily support modules loaded at initrd time.
