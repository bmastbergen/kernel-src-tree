Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/92ebd0d1.failed

As dell-laptop has been changed to always retrieve a pointer to the
SMBIOS buffer using dell_smbios_get_buffer(), the SMBIOS buffer can be
marked static.
