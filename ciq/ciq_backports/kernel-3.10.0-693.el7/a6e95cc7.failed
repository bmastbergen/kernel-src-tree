Master change notifications may occur other than when joining or
leaving a bridge, for example when being added to or removed from
a bond or Open vSwitch.

Previously in those cases rocker_port_bridge_leave() was called
which results in a null-pointer dereference as rocker_port->bridge_dev
is NULL because there is no bridge device.

This patch makes provision for doing nothing in such cases.
