Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/5e86397a.failed

When the firmware returns an error (common example is an attempt to
add twice the same rule which is refused by the some FWs), we are not
properly derefing/cleaning few resources allocated on the way.
Examples are vport vlan deref under eswitch vlan offloads, and encap
entry/neighbour deref under eswitch encapsulation offloads, fix that.

Fixes: a54e20b4fcae ('net/mlx5e: Add basic TC tunnel set action for SRIOV offloads')
Fixes: 8b32580df1cb ('net/mlx5e: Add TC vlan action for SRIOV offloads')
