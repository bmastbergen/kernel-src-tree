Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/458f280d.failed

The code validates the command_id in the response to the original
sqe command. But prior code was using the rq->rqno as the sqe command
id. The core layer overwrites what the transport set there originally.

Use the actual sqe content.
