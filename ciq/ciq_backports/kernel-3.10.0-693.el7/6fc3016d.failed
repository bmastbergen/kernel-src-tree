Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/6fc3016d.failed

VLAN obj has flags (PVID and untagged) as well as start and end vid ranges.
The switchdev driver can optimize programing the device using the ranges.
