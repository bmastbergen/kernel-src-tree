Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/dcaff16d.failed

The new APIs are enabled to offer a portable layer to access files:
 1. acpi_os_XXX_file_XXX: Wrapper of fopen/fclose/fread/fwrite
 2. acpi_os_printf: Wrapper of printf
 3. acpi_log_error: Wrapper of fprintf(stderr)

This patch deploys such mechanisms to acpidump to improve the portability
of this tool. Lv Zheng.
