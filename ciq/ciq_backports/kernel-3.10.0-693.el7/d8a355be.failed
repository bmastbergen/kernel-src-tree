Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/d8a355be.failed

In GVT-g we always emulate as pcode read/write success and ready for access
anytime, since we don't touch real physical registers here.

Add 'SKL_PCODE_CDCLK_CONTROL' write emulation, without it will cause
skl_set_cdclk fail in guest.
