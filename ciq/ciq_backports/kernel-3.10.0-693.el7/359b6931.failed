Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/359b6931.failed

Sometimes guest driver will only update partial of the GGTT entry then
access it. In this situation a failure will happen while translating
the gpa to hpa.
Now in this situation we let the corresponding shadow entry pointing
to a scratch page.
