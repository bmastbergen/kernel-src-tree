Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/5c34e022.failed

Same change as setlink.  Provide the wrapper op for SELF ndo_bridge_dellink
and call into the switchdev driver to delete afspec VLANs.
