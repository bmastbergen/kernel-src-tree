Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/2fcd82e9.failed

We silently reject offloading of IPv6 tunnels, non vxlan tunnels,
vxlan tunnels where the dst port to match is not provided, etc.

Be a bit more verbose and print a warning so the user better
realizes what went wrong here and can fix it.
