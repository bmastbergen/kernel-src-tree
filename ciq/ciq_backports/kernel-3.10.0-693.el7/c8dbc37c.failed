While testing nvme-rdma with the spdk nvmf target over iw_cxgb4, I
configured the target (mistakenly) to generate an error creating the
NVMF IO queues.  This resulted a "Invalid SQE Parameter" error sent back
to the host on the first IO queue connect:

[ 9610.928182] nvme nvme1: queue_size 128 > ctrl maxcmd 120, clamping down
[ 9610.938745] nvme nvme1: creating 32 I/O queues.

So nvmf_connect_io_queue() returns an error to
nvmf_connect_io_queue() / nvmf_connect_io_queues(), and that
is returned to nvme_rdma_create_io_queues().  In the error path,
nvmf_rdma_create_io_queues() frees the queue tagset memory _before_
stopping and freeing the IB queues, which causes yet another
touch-after-free crash due to SQ CQEs being flushed after the ib_cqe
structs pointed-to by the flushed WRs have been freed (since they are
part of the nvme_rdma_request struct).

The fix is to stop and free the queues in nvmf_connect_io_queues()
if there is an error connecting any of the queues.
