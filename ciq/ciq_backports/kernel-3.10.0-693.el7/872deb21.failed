Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Due to incorrect limit and translation register values, NTB link was
going down when the memory window was setup. Made appropriate changes
as per spec.

Fix limit register values for BAR1, which was overlapping
with the BAR23 address.
