Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/1dbd0d37.failed

The wrong key is used when extracting the address type field set by
the flower offload code. We have to use the control key and not the
basic key, fix that.
