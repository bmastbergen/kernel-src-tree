Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/8c5385cb.failed

Fix up some warnings that were identified by coccinelle:

Clean up an if/else block that can look confusing since the same statement
is executed in an "else if" check and the final "else" statement.

Change a variable from unsigned int to int since it is used in an if
statement checking the value to be less than 0.
