Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/8b71d285.failed

We allocate some memory window buffers when the link comes up, then we
provide debugfs files to read/write each side of the link.

This is useful for debugging the mapping when writing new drivers.
