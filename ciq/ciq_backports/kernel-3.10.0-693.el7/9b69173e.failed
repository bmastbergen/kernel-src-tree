Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

+  * With the RAID cache, each stripe works in two phases:
+  *	- caching phase
+  *	- writing-out phase
+  *
+  * These two phases are controlled by bit STRIPE_R5C_CACHING:
+  *   if STRIPE_R5C_CACHING == 0, the stripe is in writing-out phase
+  *   if STRIPE_R5C_CACHING == 1, the stripe is in caching phase
+  *
+  * When there is no journal, or the journal is in write-through mode,
+  * the stripe is always in writing-out phase.
+  *
+  * For write-back journal, the stripe is sent to caching phase on write
+  * (r5c_try_caching_write). r5c_make_stripe_write_out() kicks off
+  * the write-out phase by clearing STRIPE_R5C_CACHING.
+  *
+  * Stripes in caching phase do not write the raid disks. Instead, all
+  * writes are committed from the log device. Therefore, a stripe in
+  * caching phase handles writes as:
+  *	- write to log device
+  *	- return IO
+  *
+  * Stripes in writing-out phase handle writes as:
+  *	- calculate parity
+  *	- write pending data and parity to journal
+  *	- write data and parity to raid disks
+  *	- return IO for pending writes
