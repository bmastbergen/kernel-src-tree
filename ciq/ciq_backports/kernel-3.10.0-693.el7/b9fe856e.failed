There is a problem when CONFIG_RDMA_RXE=y and CONFIG_IPV6=y. This
results in the rdma_rxe initialization occurring before the IPv6
services are ready. This patch delays the initialization of rdma_rxe
until after the IPv6 services are ready. This fix is based on one
proposed by Logan Gunthorpe on a much older code base.
