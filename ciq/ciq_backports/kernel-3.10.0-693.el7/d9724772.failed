Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/d9724772.failed

When matching on flags, we should require the user to provide the
mask and avoid using an all-ones mask. Not doing so causes matching
on flags provided w.o mask to hit on the value being unset for all
flags, which may not what the user wanted to happen.
