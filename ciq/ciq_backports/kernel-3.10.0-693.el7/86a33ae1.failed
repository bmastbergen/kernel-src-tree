Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/86a33ae1.failed

According to the reverse unwinding principle, on delete time we should
first handle deletion of the steering rule and later handle the vlan
deletion from the eswitch.
