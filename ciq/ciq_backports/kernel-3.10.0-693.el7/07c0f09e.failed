Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/07c0f09e.failed

Remove rcu_read_lock protection from tunnel_key_dump and use
rtnl_dereference, dump operation is protected by  rtnl lock.

Also, remove rcu_read_lock from tunnel_key_release and use
rcu_dereference_protected.

Both operations are running exclusively and a writer couldn't modify
t->params while those functions are executed.
