Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ea7ef2ac.failed

Currently, if pd is null then we hit a null pointer derference
on accessing pd->pd_id.  Instead of just printing an error message
we should also return -EINVAL immediately.
