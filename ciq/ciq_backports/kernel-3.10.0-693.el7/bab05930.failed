Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/bab05930.failed

When untracked mmio is visited, too many log info will be printed out,
it may confuse the user, but most of the time, it is not the urgent case,
so use gvt_dbg_mmio() instead.
