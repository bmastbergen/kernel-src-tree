Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/f7bfb57b.failed

Two functions are introduced:
- fixed_mtrr_addr_to_seg() translates the address to the fixed
  MTRR segment

- fixed_mtrr_addr_seg_to_range_index() translates the address to
  the index of kvm_mtrr.fixed_ranges[]

They will be used in the later patch
