Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/686ed304.failed

Since now information about changed upper is passed along, benefit from
that and use this info directly.

This also fixes possible issues that could happen when non-master device
is added (current code does not distinguish between master and non-master
upper device).
