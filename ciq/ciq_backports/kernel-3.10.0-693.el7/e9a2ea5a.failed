Cache management software needs an id for each instance of a cache of
a particular type.

The current cacheinfo structure does not provide any information about
the underlying hardware so there is no way to expose it.

Hardware with cache management features provides means (cpuid, enumeration
etc.) to retrieve the hardware id of a particular cache instance. Cache
instances which share hardware have the same hardware id.

Add an 'id' field to struct cacheinfo to store this information. Expose
this information under the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cache/index*/
directory as well.
