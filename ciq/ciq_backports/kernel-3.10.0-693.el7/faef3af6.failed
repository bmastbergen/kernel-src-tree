Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/faef3af6.failed

Discovery controllers don't set the values. They are in reserved
areas of the Identify Controller data structure.

Given the cmd completed, the minimal capsule sizes are supported,
so no need to check nqn to detect discovery controllers and
special case validations.
