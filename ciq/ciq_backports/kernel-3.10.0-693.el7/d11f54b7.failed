Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

In the case where sglq is null, the current code just returns without
unlocking the spinlock sql_list_lock. Fix this by breaking out of the
while loop and the exit path will then unlock and return NULL as was
the original intention.
