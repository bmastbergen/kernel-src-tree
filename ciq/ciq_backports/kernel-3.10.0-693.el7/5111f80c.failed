Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/5111f80c.failed

Rocker ports will use new "swdev" hwmode for bridge port offload policy.
Current supported policy settings are BR_LEARNING and BR_LEARNING_SYNC.
User can turn on/off device port FDB learning and syncing to bridge.
