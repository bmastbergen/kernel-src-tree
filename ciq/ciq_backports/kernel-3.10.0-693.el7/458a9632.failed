Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/458a9632.failed

PTR_ERR should be applied before its argument is reassigned, otherwise the
return value will be set to 0, not error code.
