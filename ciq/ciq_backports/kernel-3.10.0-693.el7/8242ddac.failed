Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/8242ddac.failed

In the transport, in case of an interal queue error like
error completion in rdma we trigger a fatal error. However,
multiple queues in the same controller can serr error completions
and we don't want to trigger fatal error work more than once.
