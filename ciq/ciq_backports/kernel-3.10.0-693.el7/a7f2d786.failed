Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a7f2d786.failed

This fixes the slow-down of VM running with pci-passthrough, since some MTRR
range changed from MTRR_TYPE_WRBACK to MTRR_TYPE_UNCACHABLE.  Memory in the
0K-640K range was incorrectly treated as uncacheable.
