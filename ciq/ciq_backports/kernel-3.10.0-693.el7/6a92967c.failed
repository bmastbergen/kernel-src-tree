Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/6a92967c.failed

The timeout before error recovery logic kicks in is
dictated by the nvme keep-alive, so we don't really need
a transport layer retry count. transports can retry for
as much as they like.
