ACPICA commit 01eb9a58f4cf6300a0feb838a02bc4b1895c76e8
ACPICA commit de5b9c0ef1ccb264cbe57c88f6dd3fbf8229f907

The following build errors can be seen for MacOSX builds:
.../osunixxf.c:829:42: error: 'tmpnam' is deprecated: This function is provided for compatibility reasons only.  Due to security concerns inherent in the design of tmpnam(3), it is highly recommended that you use mkstemp(3) instead. [-Werror,-Wdeprecated-declarations]

Using of temporal file name functions can easily result in bus errors on
MacOSX. This patch implements anonymous semaphore using an automatic
increasing number. Lv Zheng.

Linux is not affected by this change.
