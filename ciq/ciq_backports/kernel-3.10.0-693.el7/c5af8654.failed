Per NVMe-over-Fabrics 1.0 spec, sqsize is represented as
a 0-based value.

Also per spec, the RDMA binding values shall be set
to sqsize, which makes hsqsize 0-based values.

Thus, the sqsize during NVMf connect() is now:

[root@fedora23-fabrics-host1 for-48]# dmesg
[  318.720645] nvme_fabrics: nvmf_connect_admin_queue(): sqsize for
admin queue: 31
[  318.720884] nvme nvme0: creating 16 I/O queues.
[  318.810114] nvme_fabrics: nvmf_connect_io_queue(): sqsize for i/o
queue: 127

Finally, current interpretation implies hrqsize is 1's based
so set it appropriately.
