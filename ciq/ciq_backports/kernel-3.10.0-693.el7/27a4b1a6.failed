Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/27a4b1a6.failed

mark qedr_get_state_from_ibqp(), __qedr_alloc_mr() and __qedr_post_send()
as static since they are only used in the same file.
