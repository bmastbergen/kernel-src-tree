Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/5ae0beb6.failed

Link training should be enabled in the driver probe for root port mode.
We should not have to wait for transport to be loaded for this to
happen.  Otherwise the ntb device will not show up on the transparent
bridge side of the link.
