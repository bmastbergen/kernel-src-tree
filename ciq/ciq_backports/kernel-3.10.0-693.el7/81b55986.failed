A queue head CPU, after acquiring the lock, will have to notify
the next CPU in the wait queue that it has became the new queue
head. This involves loading a new cacheline from the MCS node of the
next CPU. That operation can be expensive and add to the latency of
locking operation.

This patch addes code to optmistically prefetch the next MCS node
cacheline if the next pointer is defined and it has been spinning
for the MCS lock for a while. This reduces the locking latency and
improves the system throughput.

The performance change will depend on whether the prefetch overhead
can be hidden within the latency of the lock spin loop. On really
short critical section, there may not be performance gain at all. With
longer critical section, however, it was found to have a performance
boost of 5-10% over a range of different queue depths with a spinlock
loop microbenchmark.
