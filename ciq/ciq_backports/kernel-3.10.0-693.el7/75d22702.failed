Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

For an over-committed guest with more vCPUs than physical CPUs
available, it is possible that a vCPU may be kicked twice before
getting the lock - once before it becomes queue head and once again
before it gets the lock. All these CPU kicking and halting (VMEXIT)
can be expensive and slow down system performance.

This patch adds a new vCPU state (vcpu_hashed) which enables the code
to delay CPU kicking until at unlock time. Once this state is set,
the new lock holder will set _Q_SLOW_VAL and fill in the hash table
on behalf of the halted queue head vCPU. The original vcpu_halted
state will be used by pv_wait_node() only to differentiate other
queue nodes from the qeue head.
