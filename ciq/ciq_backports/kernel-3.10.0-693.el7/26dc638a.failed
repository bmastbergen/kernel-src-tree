commit 26dc638ae6e32bddfb8d3da0fc93946955c28c78
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/26dc638a.failed

Instead of returning immediately with an error when the link is
down, wait for the link to come up (or the user sends a SIGINT).

This is to make scripting ntb_perf easier.
