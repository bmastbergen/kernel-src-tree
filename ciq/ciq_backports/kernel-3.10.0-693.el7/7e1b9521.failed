Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/7e1b9521.failed

Currently there is no kmalloc failure check on the allocation of
the background_tracker struct in btracker_create(), and so a NULL return
will lead to a NULL pointer dereference.  Add a NULL check.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1416587 ("Dereference null return value")
