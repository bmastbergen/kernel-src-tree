commit 344770b07b7ae70639ebf110010eb6156a6e55e9
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/344770b0.failed

No reason for them to be kept around if we are
deleting the subsystem, so instead of passively
wait for the host to disconnect, actively delete
the controllers.
