Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/4133fc09.failed

Once we get a neighbour through looking up arp cache or creating a
new one in rocker_port_ipv4_resolve(), the neighbour's refcount is
already taken. But as we don't put the refcount again after it's
used, this makes the neighbour entry leaked.
