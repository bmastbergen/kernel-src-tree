Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a34ca17a.failed

If we wait until we free the controller (free_ctrl) we might
lose our rdma device without any notification while we still
have open resources (tags mrs and dma mappings).

Instead, destroy the tags with their rdma resources once we
delete the device and not when freeing it.

Note that we don't do that in nvme_rdma_shutdown_ctrl because
controller reset uses it as well and we want to give active I/O
a chance to complete successfully.
