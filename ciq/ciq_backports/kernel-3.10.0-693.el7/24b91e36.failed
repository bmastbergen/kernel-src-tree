Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/24b91e36.failed

When the tick is stopped and an interrupt occurs afterward, we check on
that interrupt exit if the next tick needs to be rescheduled. If it
doesn't need any update, we don't want to do anything.

In order to check if the tick needs an update, we compare it against the
clockevent device deadline. Now that's a problem because the clockevent
device is at a lower level than the tick itself if it is implemented
on top of hrtimer.

Every hrtimer share this clockevent device. So comparing the next tick
deadline against the clockevent device deadline is wrong because the
device may be programmed for another hrtimer whose deadline collides
with the tick. As a result we may end up not reprogramming the tick
accidentally.

In a worst case scenario under full dynticks mode, the tick stops firing
as it is supposed to every 1hz, leaving /proc/stat stalled:

      Task in a full dynticks CPU
      ----------------------------

      * hrtimer A is queued 2 seconds ahead
      * the tick is stopped, scheduled 1 second ahead
      * tick fires 1 second later
      * on tick exit, nohz schedules the tick 1 second ahead but sees
        the clockevent device is already programmed to that deadline,
        fooled by hrtimer A, the tick isn't rescheduled.
      * hrtimer A is cancelled before its deadline
      * tick never fires again until an interrupt happens...

In order to fix this, store the next tick deadline to the tick_sched
local structure and reuse that value later to check whether we need to
reprogram the clock after an interrupt.

On the other hand, ts->sleep_length still wants to know about the next
clock event and not just the tick, so we want to improve the related
comment to avoid confusion.
