Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/6c3b4f90.failed

Set lastuse statistic, when number of packets is changed compared to
last query. This was wrongly dropped when bulk counter reading was added.
