On this Dell AIO machine, the lineout jack does not work.

We found the pin 0x1a is assigned to lineout on this machine, and in
the past, we applied ALC298_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE to fix the
heaset-set mic problem for this machine, this fixup will redefine
the pin 0x1a to headphone-mic, as a result the lineout doesn't
work anymore.

After consulting with Dell, they told us this machine doesn't support
microphone via headset jack, so we add a new fixup which only defines
the pin 0x18 as the headset-mic.

[rearranged the fixup insertion position by tiwai in order to make the
 merge with other branches easier -- tiwai]
