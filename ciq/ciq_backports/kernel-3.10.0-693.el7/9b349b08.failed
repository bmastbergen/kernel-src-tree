Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/9b349b08.failed

We're designed to work with high-end devices where
direct IO makes perfect sense. We noticed that we
context switch by scheduling kblockd instead of going
directly to the device without REQ_SYNC for writes.
