Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/87aaf2ca.failed

VLANs 0 and 4095 are reserved and shouldn't be used, add checks to
switchdev similar to the bridge. Also make sure ids above 4095 cannot
be passed either.
