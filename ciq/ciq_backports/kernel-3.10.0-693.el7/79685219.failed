Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/79685219.failed

Check skip_hw flag isn't set before calling
fl_hw_{replace/destroy}_filter and fl_hw_update_stats functions.

Replace the call to tc_should_offload with tc_can_offload.
tc_can_offload only checks if the device supports offloading, the check for
skip_hw flag is done earlier in the flow.
