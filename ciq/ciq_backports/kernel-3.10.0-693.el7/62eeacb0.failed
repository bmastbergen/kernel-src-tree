Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/62eeacb0.failed

As Dan Carpenter pointed out: mixing 16-bit nvme status with 32-bit
error status from driver. Corrected comment on fcp request struct
status field, and converted done routine to explicitly set nvme status
codes for nvme status.
