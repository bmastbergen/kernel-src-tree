Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/e7335703.failed

Follow-up patcheset will allow user to change ageing_time, but for now
just hard-code it to a fixed value (the same value used as the default
for the bridge driver).
