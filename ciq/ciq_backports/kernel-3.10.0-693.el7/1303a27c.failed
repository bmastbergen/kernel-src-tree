In x86_64, since v2.6.26 the KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE is changed to 512M, and
accordingly the MODULES_VADDR is changed to 0xffffffffa0000000.  However,
in v3.12 Kees Cook introduced kaslr to randomise the location of kernel.
And the kernel text mapping addr space is enlarged from 512M to 1G.  That
means now KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE is variable, its value is 512M when kaslr
support is not compiled in and 1G when kaslr support is compiled in.
Accordingly the MODULES_VADDR is changed too to be:

    #define MODULES_VADDR    (__START_KERNEL_map + KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE)

So when kaslr is compiled in and enabled, the kernel text mapping addr
space and modules vaddr space need be adjusted.  Otherwise makedumpfile
will collapse since the addr for some symbols is not correct.

Hence KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE need be exported to vmcoreinfo and got in
makedumpfile to help calculate MODULES_VADDR.
