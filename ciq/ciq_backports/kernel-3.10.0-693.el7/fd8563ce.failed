Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/fd8563ce.failed

Before scheduling a reconnect attempt, check
nr_reconnects against max_reconnects, if not
exhausted (or max_reconnects is not -1), schedule
a reconnect attempts, otherwise schedule ctrl
removal.
