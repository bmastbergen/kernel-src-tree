Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/4aae9777.failed

On my system, dma_alloc_coherent won't produce memory anywhere
near the size of the BAR. So I needed a way to limit this.

It's pretty much copied straight from ntb_transport.
