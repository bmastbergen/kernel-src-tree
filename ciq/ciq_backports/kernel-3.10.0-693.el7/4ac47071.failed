Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/4ac47071.failed

spinlock can be initialized automatically with DEFINE_SPINLOCK()
rather than explicitly calling spin_lock_init().
