Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/21dc9e8f.failed

The CCP is meant to be more of an offload engine than an accelerator
engine. To avoid any confusion, change references to accelerator to
offload.
