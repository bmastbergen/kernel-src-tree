Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/3a20a5c3.failed

For Intel SKL platform the ME device can inform the host via
asynchronous notification that the watchdog feature was activated
on the device. The activation doesn't require reboot.
In that case the driver registers the watchdog device with the kernel.
