Build-testing this driver with -Wmaybe-uninitialized gives a new false-positive
warning that I can't really explain:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_tc.c: In function 'mlx5e_configure_flower':
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_tc.c:509:3: error: 'old_attr' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

It's obvious from the code that 'old_attr' is initialized whenever 'old'
is non-NULL here. The warning appears with all versions I tested from gcc-4.7
through gcc-6.1, and I could not come up with a way to rewrite the function
in a more readable way that avoids the warning, so I'm adding another
initialization to shut it up.
