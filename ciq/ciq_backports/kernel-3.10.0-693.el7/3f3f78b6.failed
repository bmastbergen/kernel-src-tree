Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/3f3f78b6.failed

 - kvm_mtrr_get_guest_memory_type() only checks one page in MTRRs so
   that it's unnecessary to check to see if the range is partially
   covered in MTRR

 - optimize the check of overlap memory type and add some comments
   to explain the precedence
