While this information is available by looking at the nvdimm parent
device that may not always be the case when/if we add support for other
memory regions. Tooling should not depend on walking a given ancestor
topology that is not guaranteed by the device's class. For example, a
device-dax instance will always have a dax_region parent, but it may not
always have a libnvdimm "dax" device as a grandparent.
