Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/211fcf6d.failed

The number of traffic classes reported by the hardware is zero-based
so increment the value returned to get an actual count.
