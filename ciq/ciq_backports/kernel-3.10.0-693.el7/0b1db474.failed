Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/0b1db474.failed

The JSON event lists use a different encoding for fixed counters than
perf for instructions and cycles (ref-cycles is ok)

This lead to some common events like inst_retired.any or
cpu_clk_unhalted.thread not counting, when specified with their JSON
name.

Special case these events in the jevents conversion process.  I prefer
to not touch the JSON files for this, as it's intended that standard
JSON files can be just dropped into the perf build without changes.
