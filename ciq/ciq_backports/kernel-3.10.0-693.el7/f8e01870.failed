Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/f8e01870.failed

Those beautifiers need to make sure they include what they reference,
as changes in builtin-trace.c may end up removing needed stuff, like
when undefining _GNU_SOURCE.
