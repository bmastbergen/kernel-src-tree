Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/749e6720.failed

Dump the classifier flags only if non zero and make sure to check
the return status of the handler that puts them into the netlink msg.
