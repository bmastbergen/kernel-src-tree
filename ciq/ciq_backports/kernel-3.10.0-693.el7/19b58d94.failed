Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/19b58d94.failed

With the advent of the opdone calls changing context, the lldd can no
longer assume that once the op->done call returns for RSP operations
that the request struct is no longer being accessed.

As such, revise the lldd api for a req_release callback that the
transport will call when the job is complete. This will also be used
with abort cases.

Fixed text in api header for change in io complete semantics.

Revised lpfc to support the new req_release api.
