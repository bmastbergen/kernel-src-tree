Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Since we now use a non zero mask on addr_type, we are matching on its
value (IPV4/IPV6). So before this fix, matching on enc_src_ip/enc_dst_ip
failed in SW/classify path since its value was zero.
This patch sets the proper value of addr_type for encapsulated packets.
