Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ee39fbc4.failed

As for the current generation of the mlx5 HW (CX4/CX4-Lx) per flow vlan
push/pop actions are emulated, we must not program them to the firmware.
