Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/ba09c01d.failed

A goal of the device-DAX interface is to be able to support many
exclusive allocations (partitions) of performance / feature
differentiated memory.  This count may exceed the default minors limit
of 256.

As a result of switching to an embedded cdev the inode-to-dax_dev
conversion is simplified, as well as reference counting which can switch
to the cdev kobject lifetime.
