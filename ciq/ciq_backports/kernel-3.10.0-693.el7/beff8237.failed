Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/beff8237.failed

scan_features() updates cpu_user_features but not cpu_user_features2.

Amongst other things, cpu_user_features2 contains the user TM feature
bits which we must keep in sync with the kernel TM feature bit.
