commit 60438d9a1ef4176d79739efadee122afe92904b8
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/60438d9a.failed

The logic on the test for a valid fd to close is incorrect.
This was just a mistake and was pointed out by Colin Ian King.
