Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/b15edf85.failed

No need to pass rocker_port around to alloc/free rocker functions,
since they now use switchdev_trans for memory management storage.
With the param removal, shorten the name of the functions since they now
has nothing to do with rocker port.
