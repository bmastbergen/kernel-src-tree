Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/3036dab6.failed

Instead of providing many arguments to fl_hw_{replace/destroy}_filter
functions, just provide cls_fl_filter struct that includes all the relevant
args.

This patches doesn't add any new functionality.
