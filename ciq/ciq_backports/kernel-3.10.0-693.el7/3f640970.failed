Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/3f640970.failed

One of the laptops has the codec ALC256 on it, applying the
ALC255_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE can fix the problem, the rest
of laptops have the codec ALC295 on them, they are similar to machines
with ALC225, applying the ALC269_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE can fix
the problem.
