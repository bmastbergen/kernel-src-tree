Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

On UD QP completer tasklet is scheduled for each packet sent.

If it is followed by a destroy_qp(), the kernel panic will
happen as the completer tries to operate on a destroyed QP.
