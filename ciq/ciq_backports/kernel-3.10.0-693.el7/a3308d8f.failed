Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a3308d8f.failed

Flower currently allows having the same filter twice with the same
priority. Actions (and statistics update) will always execute on the
first inserted rule leaving the second rule unused.
This patch disallows that.
