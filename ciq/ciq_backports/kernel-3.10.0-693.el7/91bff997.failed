Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/91bff997.failed

There is only a single event queue that triggers the completion
events for the RDMA CM and it is being processed serially. This means
that inherently there can no parallelism of CQ completion handler
callbacks, hence the lock is redundant.
