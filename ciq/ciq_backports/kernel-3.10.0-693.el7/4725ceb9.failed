commit 4725ceb9b70115b210a01d73318ce4430e4f0125
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/4725ceb9.failed

Well almost clean: ignore the CHECKs for space after cast operator and some
longer-than-80 char cases where for readability it's better to keep as-is.
