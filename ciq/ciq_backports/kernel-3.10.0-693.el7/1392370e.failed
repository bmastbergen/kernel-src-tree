Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/1392370e.failed

Now that we don't abuse the cmd field in struct request for nvme command
passthrough this function needs to be converted to the proper accessor
as well.
