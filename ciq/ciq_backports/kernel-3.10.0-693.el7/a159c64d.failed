Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/a159c64d.failed

nvme_uninit_ctrl already does that for us. Note that we
reordered nvme_loop_shutdown_ctrl with nvme_uninit_ctrl
but its safe because we want controller uninit to happen
before we shutdown the transport resources.
