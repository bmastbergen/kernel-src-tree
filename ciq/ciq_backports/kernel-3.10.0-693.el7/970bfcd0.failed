Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/970bfcd0.failed

When addr_type is set, mask should also be set.

Fixes: 66530bdf85eb ('sched,cls_flower: set key address type when present')
Fixes: bc3103f1ed40 ('net/sched: cls_flower: Classify packet in ip tunnels')
