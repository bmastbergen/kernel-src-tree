devm_add_action_or_reset() is a helper function which internally calls
devm_add_action().  If the devm_add_action() fails, it will execute the
action mentioned and return the error code.

Use devm_add_action_or_reset() to reduce source code size (avoid writing
the action twice) and reduce the likelihood of bugs.
