Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/27035a1b.failed

We clear the vendor error field in the work completion so that if
a work completion is erroneous  the field won't confuse the caller.
