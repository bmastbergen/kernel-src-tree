When called by HW offloading drivers, the TC action (e.g
net/sched/act_mirred.c) code uses this_cpu logic, e.g

 _bstats_cpu_update(this_cpu_ptr(a->cpu_bstats), bytes, packets)

per the kernel documention, preemption should be disabled, add that.

Before the fix, when running with CONFIG_PREEMPT set, we get a

BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: tc/3793

asserion from the TC action (mirred) stats_update callback.
