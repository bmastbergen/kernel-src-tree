Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-693.el7/c913a8b0.failed

Link LS's on the remoteport rather than the controller. LS's are
between nport's. Makes more sense, especially on async teardown where
the controller is torn down regardless of the LS (LS is more of a notifier
to the target of the teardown), to have them on the remoteport.

While revising ls send/done routines, issues were seen relative to
refcounting and cleanup, especially in async path. Reworked these code
paths.
