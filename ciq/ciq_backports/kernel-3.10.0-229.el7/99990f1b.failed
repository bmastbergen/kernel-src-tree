Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/99990f1b.failed

This function can be called now with i915 interrupts enabled, so the
corresponding WARN is incorrect, remove it. I think this was spotted by
Paulo during his review, but since I already removed the same WARN
from intel_suspend_gt_powersave() I missed then his point.
