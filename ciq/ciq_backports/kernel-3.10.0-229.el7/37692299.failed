Michal Sekletar added in commit ea02f9411d9f ("net: introduce
SO_BPF_EXTENSIONS") a facility where user space can enquire
the BPF ancillary instruction set, which is imho a step into
the right direction for letting user space high-level to BPF
optimizers make an informed decision for possibly using these
extensions.

The original rationale was to return through a getsockopt(2)
a bitfield of which instructions are supported and which
are not, as of right now, we just return 0 to indicate a
base support for SKF_AD_PROTOCOL up to SKF_AD_PAY_OFFSET.
Limitations of this approach are that this API which we need
to maintain for a long time can only support a maximum of 32
extensions, and needs to be additionally maintained/updated
when each new extension that comes in.

I thought about this a bit more and what we can do here to
overcome this is to just return SKF_AD_MAX. Since we never
remove any extension since we cannot break user space and
always linearly increase SKF_AD_MAX on each newly added
extension, user space can make a decision on what extensions
are supported in the whole set of extensions and which aren't,
by just checking which of them from the whole set have an
offset < SKF_AD_MAX of the underlying kernel.

Since SKF_AD_MAX must be updated each time we add new ones,
we don't need to introduce an additional enum and got
maintenance for free. At some point in time when
SO_BPF_EXTENSIONS becomes ubiquitous for most kernels, then
an application can simply make use of this and easily be run
on newer or older underlying kernels without needing to be
recompiled, of course. Since that is for 3.14, it's not too
late to do this change.
