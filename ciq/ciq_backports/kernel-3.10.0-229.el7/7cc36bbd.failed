vmstat workers are used for folding counter differentials into the zone,
per node and global counters at certain time intervals.  They currently
run at defined intervals on all processors which will cause some holdoff
for processors that need minimal intrusion by the OS.

The current vmstat_update mechanism depends on a deferrable timer firing
every other second by default which registers a work queue item that runs
on the local CPU, with the result that we have 1 interrupt and one
additional schedulable task on each CPU every 2 seconds If a workload
indeed causes VM activity or multiple tasks are running on a CPU, then
there are probably bigger issues to deal with.

However, some workloads dedicate a CPU for a single CPU bound task.  This
is done in high performance computing, in high frequency financial
applications, in networking (Intel DPDK, EZchip NPS) and with the advent
of systems with more and more CPUs over time, this may become more and
more common to do since when one has enough CPUs one cares less about
efficiently sharing a CPU with other tasks and more about efficiently
monopolizing a CPU per task.

The difference of having this timer firing and workqueue kernel thread
scheduled per second can be enormous.  An artificial test measuring the
worst case time to do a simple "i++" in an endless loop on a bare metal
system and under Linux on an isolated CPU with dynticks and with and
without this patch, have Linux match the bare metal performance (~700
cycles) with this patch and loose by couple of orders of magnitude (~200k
cycles) without it[*].  The loss occurs for something that just calculates
statistics.  For networking applications, for example, this could be the
difference between dropping packets or sustaining line rate.

Statistics are important and useful, but it would be great if there would
be a way to not cause statistics gathering produce a huge performance
difference.  This patche does just that.

This patch creates a vmstat shepherd worker that monitors the per cpu
differentials on all processors.  If there are differentials on a
processor then a vmstat worker local to the processors with the
differentials is created.  That worker will then start folding the diffs
in regular intervals.  Should the worker find that there is no work to be
done then it will make the shepherd worker monitor the differentials
again.

With this patch it is possible then to have periods longer than
2 seconds without any OS event on a "cpu" (hardware thread).

The patch shows a very minor increased in system performance.
