commit 406d49656f80b1e6d37d67e187a640243ed87ba9
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/406d4965.failed

Command line parameters QueuePairs, Node, EEE, DMAC and InterruptThrottleRate
do not exist these days. Remove all references to them in the Documentation
folder and update code comments.
