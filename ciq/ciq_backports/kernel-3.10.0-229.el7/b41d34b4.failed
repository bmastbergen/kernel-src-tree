Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/b41d34b4.failed

New system call depends on crypto.  As it did not have a separate config
option, CONFIG_KEXEC was modified to select CRYPTO and CRYPTO_SHA256.

But now previous patch introduced a new config option for new syscall.
So CONFIG_KEXEC does not require crypto.  Remove that dependency.

+ 	help
+ 	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
+ 	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
+ 	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
+ 	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.
+ 
+ 	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.
+ 
+ 	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
+ 	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
+ 	  initially work for you.  As of this writing the exact hardware
+ 	  interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be
+ 	  made.

+ config BOOTINFO_PROC

+ 	help
+ 	  Say Y to export the bootinfo used to boot the kernel in a
+ 	  "bootinfo" file in procfs.  This is useful with kexec.
