The scsi and cfg80211 plugins cast between unsigned long long and
pointers, which is problematic for architectures where unsigned long
long is wider than the native pointer size:

  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_scsi.c: In function ‘process_scsi_trace_parse_cdb’:
  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_scsi.c:408:26: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
    scsi_trace_parse_cdb(s, (unsigned char *) args[1], args[2]);

  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_cfg80211.c: In function ‘process___le16_to_cpup’:
  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_cfg80211.c:11:18: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
    uint16_t *val = (uint16_t *) args[0];

This patch adds an intermediate cast to unsigned long, silencing the
warning.
