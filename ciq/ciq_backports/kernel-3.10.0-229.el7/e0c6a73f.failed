Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/e0c6a73f.failed

The ->gem_free_object never gets called with a NULL pointer, the check
is redundant. Also checking after the upcast allows compilers to elide
it anyway.

Noticed while chasing coverity reports, somehow this one here was not
flagged.
