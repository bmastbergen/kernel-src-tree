Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/61e4ce08.failed

This was originally set to 4 times the IO timeout, but that was when
the IO timeout was 5 seconds instead of 30. 20 seconds for total time
to failure seemed more reasonable than 2 minutes for most, but other
users have requested to make this a module parameter instead.

[renamed the module parameter to retry_time]
