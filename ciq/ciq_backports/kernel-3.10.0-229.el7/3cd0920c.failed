Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/3cd0920c.failed

The code to free a signed info block is repeated several times, so move the
code to do it into a function of its own.  This gives us a place to add clean
ups for stuff that gets added to pkcs7_signed_info.
