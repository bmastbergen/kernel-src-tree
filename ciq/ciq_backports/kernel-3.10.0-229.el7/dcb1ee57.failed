Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/dcb1ee57.failed

ttm_bo_unref unconditionally calls kref_put on it's argument, so the
thing can't be NULL without already causing Oopses.
