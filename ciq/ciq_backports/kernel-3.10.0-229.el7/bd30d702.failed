Commit b8a8684502a0f introduced an accidental flag aliasing between
EXT4_EX_NOCACHE and EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_CONVERT_UNWRITTEN.

Fortunately, this didn't introduce any untorward side effects --- we
got lucky.  Nevertheless, fix this and leave a warning to hopefully
avoid this from happening in the future.
