Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/7b0a48f3.failed

From azx_interrupt, use the helper to check if the device is active
instead of checking the state.  This will do the right thing if
runtime pm is disabled in addition to if the device is suspended.
