Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/8fa6a425.failed

sparse complains about these functions missing a prototype, but looking
closer they aren't (and likely not supposed to be) used outside of this
source file, so they can be made static.
