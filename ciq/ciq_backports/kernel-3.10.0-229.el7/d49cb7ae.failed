Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/d49cb7ae.failed

commit 421e08c41fda fixed the reported min/max for the X and Y axis,
but unfortunately, it broke the resolution of those same axis.

On the t540p, the resolution is the same regarding X and Y. It is not
a problem for xf86-input-synaptics because this driver is only interested
in the ratio between X and Y.
Unfortunately, xf86-input-cmt uses directly the resolution, and having a
null resolution leads to some divide by 0 errors, which are translated by
-infinity in the resulting coordinates.
