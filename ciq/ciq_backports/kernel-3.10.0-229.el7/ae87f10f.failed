Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/ae87f10f.failed

CPUFreq core doesn't control value of .driver_data and this field is
completely driver specific. This can contain any value and not only
indexes. For most of the drivers, which aren't using this field, its
value is zero. So, printing this from core doesn't make any sense.
Don't print it.
