Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-229.el7/9832235f.failed

cpufreq drivers that provide the ->setpolicy() callback are supposed
to have integrated governors, so they don't need to set ->target()
or ->target_index() and may confuse the core if any of these callbacks
is present.

For this reason, add a check preventing ->setpolicy cpufreq drivers
from registering if they have non-NULL ->target or ->target_index.
