Before this patch, function do_xmote just assumed all the writes
submitted to the journal were finished and successful, and it
called the go_unlock function to release the dlm lock. But if
they're not, and a revoke failed to make its way to the journal,
a journal replay on another node will cause corruption if we
let the go_inval function continue and tell dlm to release the
glock to another node. This patch adds a couple checks for errors
in do_xmote after the calls to go_sync and go_inval. If an error
is found, we cannot withdraw yet, because the withdraw itself
uses glocks to make the file system read-only. Instead, we flag
the error. Later, asserts should cause another node to replay
the journal before continuing, thus protecting rgrp and dinode
glocks and maintaining the integrity of the metadata. Note that
we only need to do this for journaled glocks. System glocks
should be able to progress even under withdrawn conditions.
