Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/14227ce9.failed

The struct tlmi_pwd_setting display_name member is initialized,
but never read. Remove it and the TLMI_PWDTYPE_MAXLEN define.

While at it also remove some other unused [MAX]LEN defines.
