Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/ea7ada4d.failed

The XR21V141X does not have a 5- or 6-bit mode, but the current
implementation failed to properly restore the old setting when CS5 or
CS6 was requested. Instead an invalid request would be sent to the
device.
