Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/d0f1d5ae.failed

When thrustmaster_probe() handles errors of usb_submit_urb() it does not
free allocated resources and fails. The patch fixes that.

Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).
