Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/0128cc6e.failed

After commit a8f89fa27773 ("ice: do not abort devlink info if board
identifier can't be found"), the getter/fallback() functions no longer
report an error. Convert the interface to a void so that it is no
longer possible to add a version field that is fatal. This makes
sense, because we should not fail to report other versions just
because one of the version pieces could not be found.

Finally, clean up the getter functions line wrapping so that none of
them take more than 80 columns, as is the usual style for networking
files.
