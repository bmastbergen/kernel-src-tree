Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/0fdf10e5.failed

Currently attributes will show things like:
`BootOrderLock,Disable`
rather than just
`Disable`.

Of course this works, but the attribute is intended to be read by
userspace tools and not require further processing.  That is a userspace
tool can display a drop down of `possible_values` and `current_value` is
one of them from the list.

This also aligns `think-lmi` with how `dell-wmi-sysman` works.
