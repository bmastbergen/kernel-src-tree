Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Getting a report (e.g. feature report) from a device requires us to send
a request indicating which report we want to retrieve and then waiting
for the corresponding response containing that report. We already
provide the response structure to the request call, but the request
isn't marked as a request that expects a response. Thus the request
returns before we receive the response and the response buffer indicates
a zero length response due to that.

This essentially means that the get-report calls are broken and will
always indicate that a report of length zero has been read.

Fix this by appropriately marking the request.
