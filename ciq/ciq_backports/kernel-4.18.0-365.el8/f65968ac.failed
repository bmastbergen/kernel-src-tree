Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/f65968ac.failed

When CONFIG_KUNIT is not enabled, __kunit_fail_current_test() an empty
static function.

But GCC complains about unused static functions, *unless* they're static
inline.  So add inline to make GCC happy.
