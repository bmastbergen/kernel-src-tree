Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/17749ece.failed

Since the surfaces of tiled FBs on ADLP are remapped it's pointless to
require an alignment in the allocated object. The necessary tile-row
alignment (to be programmed to the surface start register) will be
ensured later when flipping to the FB.
