ADL-P now has its own set of DDI buf translation tables (except for eDP
which appears to be the same as TGL).  Add the new values (last updated
in bspec 2021-07-22) to the driver.

v2:
 - Actually hook up the new tables via encoder->get_buf_trans()

v3:
 - Create extra table wrapper structures for the tables from past
   platforms that we're re-using, with names that more accurately
   reflect the link rate they apply to on ADL-P specifically.  (Jose)
