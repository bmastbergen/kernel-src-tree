Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/a3836a02.failed

Move static GUID variable out of the function and add a comment
how it looks like in the human readable representation.

While at it, include uuid.h since the guid_t type is defined in it.
