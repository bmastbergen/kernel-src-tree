Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Fix up B0 handling which should leave the baud rate unchanged and
specifically not report back a non-B0 rate when B0 is requested; must
temporarily disable hardware flow control so that RTS can be deasserted;
and should reassert DTR/RTS when moving from B0.
