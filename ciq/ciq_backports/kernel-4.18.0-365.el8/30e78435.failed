tlmi_sysfs_init() calls tlmi_release_attr() on errors which calls
kobject_put() for attributes created by tlmi_analyze(), but if we
bail early because of an error, then this means that some of the
kobjects will not have been initialized yet; and we should thus not
call kobject_put() on them.

Switch from using kobject_init_and_add() inside tlmi_sysfs_init() to
initializing all the created kobjects directly in tlmi_analyze() and
only adding them from tlmi_sysfs_init(). This way all kobjects will
always be initialized when tlmi_release_attr() gets called.
