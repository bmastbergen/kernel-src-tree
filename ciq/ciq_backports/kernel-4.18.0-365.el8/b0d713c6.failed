We want to convert from 16 bit (unsigned) little endian values contained
in a packed struct to CPU native endian values here, not the other way
around. So replace cpu_to_le16() with get_unaligned_le16(), using the
latter instead of le16_to_cpu() to acknowledge that we are reading from
a packed struct.
