Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

The tile size for all surface types is 4 kbyte (or 2 kbyte on old
platforms), with the exception of the TGL/ADL CCS surface where the tile
size is 64 bytes. To be able to remap CCS FBs the CCS surface tile needs
to be defined as 4 kbyte as well (the granularity of GTT pages in a
remapped view).

The only place using the dimension of the 64 byte CCS area is the initial
check for the main vs. CCS plane origin coordinate match. To prepare for
adding support for remapping CCS FBs let's call the 64 byte CCS area a
'tile block' and add a helper to retrieve the dimensions for it.

No functional change.
