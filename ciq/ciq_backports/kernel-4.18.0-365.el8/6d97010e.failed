Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/6d97010e.failed

Currently the ACPI companion and handle are retrieved and checked
a few times in different functions. Instead get ACPI companion only
once and reuse it everywhere.
