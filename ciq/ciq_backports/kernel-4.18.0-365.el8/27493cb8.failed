Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/27493cb8.failed

Specification asks for DC_STATE_DEBUG_MASK_CORES to be set for all
platforms that supports DMC, not only for geminilake and broxton.

While at is also taking the oportunity to simply the code.
