Since the timer stack (hardware and KVM) is per-CPU, there
are potential chances for races to occur when the scheduler
decides to migrate a vCPU thread to a different physical CPU.
Hence, include an option to stress-test this part as well by
forcing the vCPUs to migrate across physical CPUs in the
system at a particular rate.

Originally, the bug for the fix with commit 3134cc8beb69d0d
("KVM: arm64: vgic: Resample HW pending state on deactivation")
was discovered using arch_timer test with vCPU migrations and
can be easily reproduced.
