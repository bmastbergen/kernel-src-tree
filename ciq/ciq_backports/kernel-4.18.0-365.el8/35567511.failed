Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/35567511.failed

Shift the line-setting values when defining them rather than in
set_termios() for consistency and improved readability.
