XSAVE state is thread-local.  The kernel switches between thread
state at context switch time.  Generally, running a selftest for
a while will naturally expose it to some context switching and
and will test the XSAVE code.

Instead of just hoping that the tests get context-switched at
random times, force context-switches on purpose.  Spawn off a few
userspace threads and force context-switches between them.
Ensure that the kernel correctly context switches each thread's
unique AMX state.
