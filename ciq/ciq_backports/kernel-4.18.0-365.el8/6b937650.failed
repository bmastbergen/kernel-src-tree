Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/6b937650.failed

We don't care about __iomem mismatch when dealing with error
pointers. Silence it with ERR_CAST().

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_dpt.c:136:21: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_dpt.c:136:21:    expected struct i915_vma *[assigned] vma
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_dpt.c:136:21:    got void [noderef] __iomem *[assigned] iomem

v2: The code moved into intel_dpt.c
