Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/23dcd749.failed

We must not free the possible_values string before we have called
sysfs_remove_group(kobj, &tlmi_attr_group) otherwise there is a race
where a sysfs read of possible_values could reference the free-ed
memory.

Move the kfree(setting->possible_values) together with the free of the
actual tlmi_attr_setting struct to avoid this race.
