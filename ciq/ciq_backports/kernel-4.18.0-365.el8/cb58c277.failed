Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/cb58c277.failed

The dell-wmi-sysman and think-lmi kernel modules both have a global
struct class *fw_attr_class variable, leading to the following compile
errors when both are builtin:

ld: drivers/platform/x86/think-lmi.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `fw_attr_class'; drivers/platform/x86/dell/dell-wmi-sysman/sysman.o:(.bss+0x0): first defined here

In both cases the variable is only used in the file where it is declared.
Make both declarations static to avoid the linker error.
