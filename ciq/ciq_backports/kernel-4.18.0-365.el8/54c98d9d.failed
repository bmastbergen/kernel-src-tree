Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/54c98d9d.failed

Make sure to release the control interface at disconnect so that the
driver can be unbound without leaking resources (and later rebound).
