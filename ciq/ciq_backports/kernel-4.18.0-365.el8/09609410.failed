Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/09609410.failed

The driver depends on ACPI, ACPI_PTR() resolution is always the same.
Otherwise a compiler may produce a warning.

That said, the rule of thumb either ugly ifdeffery with ACPI_PTR or
none should be used in a driver.
