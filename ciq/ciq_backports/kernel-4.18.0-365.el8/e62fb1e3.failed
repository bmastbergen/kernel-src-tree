Move the pending_reboot node under attributes dir where it should live, as
documented in: Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-firmware-attributes.

Also move the create / remove code to be together with the other code
populating / cleaning the attributes sysfs dir. In the removal path this
is necessary so that the remove is done before the
kset_unregister(tlmi_priv.attribute_kset) call.
