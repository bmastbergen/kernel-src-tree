Claiming the sibling control interface is a bit more involved and
specifically requires adding support to USB-serial core for managing
either interface being unbound first, something which could otherwise
lead to a NULL-pointer dereference.

Similarly, additional infrastructure is also needed to handle suspend
properly.

Since the driver currently isn't actually using the control interface,
we can defer this for now by simply not claiming the control interface.
