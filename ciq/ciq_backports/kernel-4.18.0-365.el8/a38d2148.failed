Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/a38d2148.failed

Make sure that the probed device has an interface 0 to avoid
dereferencing a NULL pointer in case of a malicious device or during
USB-descriptor fuzzing.
