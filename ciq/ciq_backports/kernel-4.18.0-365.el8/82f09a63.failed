Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/82f09a63.failed

The ft260_hid_feature_report_get() checks if the return size matches the
requested size. But the function can also fail with at least -ENOMEM.  Add the
< 0 checks.

In ft260_hid_feature_report_get(), do not do the memcpy to the caller's buffer
if there is an error.
