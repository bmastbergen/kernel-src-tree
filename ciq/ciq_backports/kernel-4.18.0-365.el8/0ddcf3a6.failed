Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-365.el8/0ddcf3a6.failed

If length equals 0 then reading buf[length-1] will read before the start
of the buffer.

Avoid this by moving the length == 0 check up.
