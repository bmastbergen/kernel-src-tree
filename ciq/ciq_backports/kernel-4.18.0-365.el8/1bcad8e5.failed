Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

On an AMD based Lenovo T14, I find that the module doesn't work at
all, and instead has a traceback with messages like:

```
sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/virtual/firmware-attributes/thinklmi/attributes/Reserved'
```

Duplicate and reserved values showing up appear to be a firmware bug,
but they shouldn't make the driver explode.  So catch them and skip
them.
