Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/16f3fd3d.failed

Don't bother with the link check during probe, let
the watchdog notice the first link-up.  This allows
probe to finish cleanly without any interruptions
from over excited user programs opening the device
as soon as it is registered.
