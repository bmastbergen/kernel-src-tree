Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/ecd2d8b0.failed

If we don't set a port type, the devlink code will eventually
print a WARN in the kernel log.  Because the mgmt device is
not really a useful port, don't register it as a devlink port.
