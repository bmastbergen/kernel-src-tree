Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

When restoring SVM nested state, the control state cache in svm->nested
will have to be filled, but the save state will not have to be moved
into svm->vmcb.  Therefore, pull the code that handles the control area
into a separate function.
