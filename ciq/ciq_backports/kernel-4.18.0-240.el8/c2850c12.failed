Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/c2850c12.failed

[Why]
When content type property is set to 1. We should enable hdcp2.2 and if we cant
then stop. Currently the way it works in DC is that if we fail hdcp2, we will
try hdcp1 after.

[How]
Use link config to force disable hdcp1.4 when type1 is set.
