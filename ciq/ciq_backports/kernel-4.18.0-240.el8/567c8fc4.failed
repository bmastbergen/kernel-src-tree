Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/567c8fc4.failed

As the pmfw hasn't exported the interface of SMU feature
mask to APU SKU so just force on all the features to driver
inquired interface at early initial stage.
