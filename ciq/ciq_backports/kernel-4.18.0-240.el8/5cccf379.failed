commit 5cccf3797435008b7cd8d9d98d37db3962368710
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/5cccf379.failed

- Use title markups;
- adjust indentation and add blank lines as needed;
- adjust tables to match ReST accepted formats;
- use :field: markups.

-XICS interrupt controller
-
-Device type supported: KVM_DEV_TYPE_XICS
-
-Groups:
-  KVM_DEV_XICS_SOURCES
-  Attributes: One per interrupt source, indexed by the source number.
-
-This device emulates the XICS (eXternal Interrupt Controller
-Specification) defined in PAPR.  The XICS has a set of interrupt
-sources, each identified by a 20-bit source number, and a set of
-Interrupt Control Presentation (ICP) entities, also called "servers",
-each associated with a virtual CPU.
-
-The ICP entities are created by enabling the KVM_CAP_IRQ_ARCH
-capability for each vcpu, specifying KVM_CAP_IRQ_XICS in args[0] and
-the interrupt server number (i.e. the vcpu number from the XICS's
-point of view) in args[1] of the kvm_enable_cap struct.  Each ICP has
-64 bits of state which can be read and written using the
-KVM_GET_ONE_REG and KVM_SET_ONE_REG ioctls on the vcpu.  The 64 bit
-state word has the following bitfields, starting at the
-least-significant end of the word:
-
-* Unused, 16 bits
-
-* Pending interrupt priority, 8 bits
-  Zero is the highest priority, 255 means no interrupt is pending.
-
-* Pending IPI (inter-processor interrupt) priority, 8 bits
-  Zero is the highest priority, 255 means no IPI is pending.
-
-* Pending interrupt source number, 24 bits
-  Zero means no interrupt pending, 2 means an IPI is pending
-
-* Current processor priority, 8 bits
-  Zero is the highest priority, meaning no interrupts can be
-  delivered, and 255 is the lowest priority.
-
-Each source has 64 bits of state that can be read and written using
-the KVM_GET_DEVICE_ATTR and KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR ioctls, specifying the
-KVM_DEV_XICS_SOURCES attribute group, with the attribute number being
-the interrupt source number.  The 64 bit state word has the following
-bitfields, starting from the least-significant end of the word:
-
-* Destination (server number), 32 bits
-  This specifies where the interrupt should be sent, and is the
-  interrupt server number specified for the destination vcpu.
-
-* Priority, 8 bits
-  This is the priority specified for this interrupt source, where 0 is
-  the highest priority and 255 is the lowest.  An interrupt with a
-  priority of 255 will never be delivered.
-
-* Level sensitive flag, 1 bit
-  This bit is 1 for a level-sensitive interrupt source, or 0 for
-  edge-sensitive (or MSI).
-
-* Masked flag, 1 bit
-  This bit is set to 1 if the interrupt is masked (cannot be delivered
-  regardless of its priority), for example by the ibm,int-off RTAS
-  call, or 0 if it is not masked.
-
-* Pending flag, 1 bit
-  This bit is 1 if the source has a pending interrupt, otherwise 0.
-
-Only one XICS instance may be created per VM.
