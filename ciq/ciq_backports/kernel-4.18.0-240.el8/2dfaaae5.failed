Rename the devlink-info-versions.rst file to a plain devlink-info.rst
file. Add additional paragraphs explaining what devlink-info is for,
and the expectation that drivers use the generic names where plausible.

Note that drivers which use non-standard info version names ought to
document these in a driver-specific info-versions.rst file.
