Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f241d711.failed

Split out filling svm->vmcb.save and svm->vmcb.control before VMRUN.
Only the latter will be useful when restoring nested SVM state.

This patch introduces no semantic change, so the MMU setup is still
done in nested_prepare_vmcb_save.  The next patch will clean up things.
