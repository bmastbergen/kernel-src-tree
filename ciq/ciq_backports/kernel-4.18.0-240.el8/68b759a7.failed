Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/68b759a7.failed

The fw_status field is only 8 bits, so fix the read.  Also,
we only want to look at the one status bit, to allow for future
use of the other bits, and watch for a bad PCI read.
