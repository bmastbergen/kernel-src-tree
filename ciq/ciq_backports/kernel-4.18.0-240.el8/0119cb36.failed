Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

When running the demand paging test with the -u option, the User Fault
FD handler essentially adds an arbitrary delay to page fault resolution.
To enable better simulation of a real demand paging scenario, add a
configurable delay to the UFFD handler.
