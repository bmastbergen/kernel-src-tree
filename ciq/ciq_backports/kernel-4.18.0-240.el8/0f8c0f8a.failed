Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/0f8c0f8a.failed

Now devicetree is supported for probing soundwire as well.

On platforms built with !ACPI !OF (ie s390x) the device still cannot be
probed and gives a build warning.
