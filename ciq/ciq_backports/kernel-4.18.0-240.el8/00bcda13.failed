Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/00bcda13.failed

We want to use the cancel functionality for canceling based on not
just the work itself. Instead of matching on the work address
manually, allow a match handler to tell us if we found the right work
item or not.

No functional changes in this patch.
