Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/909e0aba.failed

This patch introduces test_add_max_memory_regions(), which checks
that a VM can have added memory slots up to the limit defined in
KVM_CAP_NR_MEMSLOTS. Then attempt to add one more slot to
verify it fails as expected.
