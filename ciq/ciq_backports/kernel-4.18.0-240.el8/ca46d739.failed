Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/ca46d739.failed

The authoritative state does not come from the VMCB once in guest mode,
but KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE can still perform checks on L1's provided SVM
controls because we get them from userspace.

Therefore, split out a function to do them.
