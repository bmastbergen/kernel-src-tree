Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/53faea3d.failed

Don't worry if the rx filter add firmware request fails on
EEXIST, at least we know the filter is there.  Same for
the delete request, at least we know it isn't there.
