Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/1fcbb75c.failed

Add the perf_evlist_mmap_ops::idx callback to be called in
mmap_per_cpu() and mmap_per_thread() with current cpu and thread
indexes.

It's used by current aux code, so perf will use this callback to set the
aux index.
