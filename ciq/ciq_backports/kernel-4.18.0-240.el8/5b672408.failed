commit 5b672408660e309ce7d54462eea050d5e5d0fc3d
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/5b672408.failed

The usual drill at this point, except there is no code to remove because this
case was not handled at all.
