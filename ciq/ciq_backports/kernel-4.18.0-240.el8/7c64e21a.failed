Kdump kernel, used for capturing the kernel core image, is supposed
to use only specific memory regions to avoid corrupting the image to
be captured. The regions are crashkernel range - the memory reserved
explicitly for kdump kernel, memory used for the tce-table, the OPAL
region and RTAS region as applicable. Restrict kdump kernel memory
to use only these regions by setting up usable-memory DT property.
Also, tell the kdump kernel to run at the loaded address by setting
the magic word at 0x5c.
