kvm_mmu_new_pgd() refers to arch.mmu and at this point it still references
arch.guest_mmu while arch.root_mmu is expected.

Note, the change is effectively a nop: when !npt_enabled,
nested_svm_uninit_mmu_context() does nothing (as we don't do
nested_svm_init_mmu_context()) and with npt_enabled we don't
do kvm_set_cr3().  However, it will matter when we move the
call to kvm_mmu_new_pgd into nested_svm_load_cr3().

No functional change intended.
