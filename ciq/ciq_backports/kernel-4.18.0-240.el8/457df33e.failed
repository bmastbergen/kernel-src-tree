Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/457df33e.failed

bio_alloc() can fail when we use GFP_NORETRY.  If it does, allocate
a bio large enough for a single page like mpage_readpages() does.
