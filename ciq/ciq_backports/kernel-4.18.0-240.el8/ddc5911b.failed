Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Since the fw has been re-inited, we need to refresh the port
information dma address so we can see fresh port information.
Let's call ionic_port_init again, and tweak it to allow for
a call to simply refresh the existing dma address.
