Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/9cd0ed63.failed

If we encounter an IO error during writeback, log the inode, offset, and
sector number of the failure, instead of forcing the user to do some
sort of reverse mapping to figure out which file is affected.
