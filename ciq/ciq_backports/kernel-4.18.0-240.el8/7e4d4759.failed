Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/7e4d4759.failed

The NIC's filters are lost in the midst of the fw-upgrade
so we need to replay them into the FW.  We also remove the
unused ionic_rx_filter_del() function.
