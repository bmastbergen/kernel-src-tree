Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/c032dd8c.failed

Add ping tests to fcnal-test.sh. Covers the permutations of directly
connected addresses, routed destinations, VRF and non-VRF, and expected
failures.

Setup includes unreachable routes and fib rules blocking traffic.
