commit 6334b91e502ca1ec10157f2a3a2c74eea6b5e279
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/6334b91e.failed

Add some tracepoints so that we can more easily debug what the
filesystem is returning from ->iomap_begin.
