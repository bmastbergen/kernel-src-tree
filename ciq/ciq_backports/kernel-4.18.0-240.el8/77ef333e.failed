Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/77ef333e.failed

[WHY]
The downspread percentage was copied over from a previous version
of the display_mode_lib spreadsheet. This value has been updated,
and the previous value is too high to allow for such modes as
4K120hz. The new value is sufficient for such modes.

[HOW]
Update the value in dcn21_resource to match the spreadsheet.
