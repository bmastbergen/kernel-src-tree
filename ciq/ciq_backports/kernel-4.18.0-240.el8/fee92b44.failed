Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/fee92b44.failed

We were getting it by luck, from files included before internal/evsel.h
where it is being included.

Fixes: 9dfcb7599084 ("libperf: Move fd array from perf's evsel to lobperf's perf_evsel class")
