Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

There is only one GIF flag for the whole processor, so make sure it is not clobbered
when switching to L2 (in which case we also have to include the V_GIF_ENABLE_MASK,
lest we confuse enable_gif/disable_gif/gif_set).  When going back, L1 could in
theory have entered L2 without issuing a CLGI so make sure the svm_set_gif is
done last, after svm->vmcb->control.int_ctl has been copied back from hsave.
