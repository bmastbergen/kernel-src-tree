Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/9cd3e2c6.failed

Now that devlink regions can be triggered via
DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_TRIGGER, document this in the devlink-region.rst
file.
