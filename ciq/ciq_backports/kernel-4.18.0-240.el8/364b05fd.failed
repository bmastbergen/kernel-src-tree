Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/364b05fd.failed

The callback function of call_rcu() just calls kfree(), so we can use
kfree_rcu() instead of call_rcu() + callback function.
