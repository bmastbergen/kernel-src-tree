Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/6f72653e.failed

We don't know what context we'll be called in for cancel, it could very
well be with IRQs disabled already. Use the IRQ saving variants of the
locking primitives.
