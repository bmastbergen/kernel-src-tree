commit ab11fe5af1049598d1ff73014f3ea65663246a6e
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/ab11fe5a.failed

Document the fact that the strategy function passed in can
control whether to continue iterating or not.
