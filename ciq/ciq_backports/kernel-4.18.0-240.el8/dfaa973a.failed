The Ultravisor is expected to explicitly call H_SVM_PAGE_IN for all the
pages of the SVM before calling H_SVM_INIT_DONE. This causes a huge
delay in tranistioning the VM to SVM. The Ultravisor is only interested
in the pages that contain the kernel, initrd and other important data
structures. The rest contain throw-away content.

However if not all pages are requested by the Ultravisor, the Hypervisor
continues to consider the GFNs corresponding to the non-requested pages
as normal GFNs. This can lead to data-corruption and undefined behavior.

In H_SVM_INIT_DONE handler, move all the PFNs associated with the SVM's
GFNs to secure-PFNs. Skip the GFNs that are already Paged-in or Shared
or Paged-in followed by a Paged-out.
