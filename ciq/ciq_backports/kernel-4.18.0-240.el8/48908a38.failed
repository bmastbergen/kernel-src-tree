Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/48908a38.failed

Without this fix, git is confused. It generates wrong
function context for code changes in subsequent patches.
Weird, but true.
