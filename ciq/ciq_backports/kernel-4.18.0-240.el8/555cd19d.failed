Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/555cd19d.failed

Add the appropriate header for using dynamic_hex_dump(), which
seems to be incidentally included in some configurations but
not all.
