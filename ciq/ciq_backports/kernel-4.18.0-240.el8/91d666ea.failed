Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/91d666ea.failed

We hold the wqe lock at this point (which is also annotated), so there's
no need to use the careful variant of list_empty().
