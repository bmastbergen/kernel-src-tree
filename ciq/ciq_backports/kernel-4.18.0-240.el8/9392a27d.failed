commit 9392a27d88b9707145d713654eb26f0c29789e50
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/9392a27d.failed

Some work items need this for relative path lookup, make it available
like the other inherited credentials/mm/etc.
