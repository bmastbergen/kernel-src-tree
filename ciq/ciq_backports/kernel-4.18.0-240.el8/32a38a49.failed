Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/32a38a49.failed

Use the existing iomap write_begin code to read the pages unshared
by iomap_file_unshare.  That avoids the extra ->readpage call and
extent tree lookup currently done by read_mapping_page.
