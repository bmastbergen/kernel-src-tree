Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/80ad8943.failed

io_wq_flush() is buggy, during cancelation of a flush, the associated
work may be passed to the caller's (i.e. io_uring) @match callback. That
callback is expecting it to be embedded in struct io_kiocb. Cancelation
of internal work probably doesn't make a lot of sense to begin with.

As the flush helper is no longer used, just delete it and the associated
work flag.
