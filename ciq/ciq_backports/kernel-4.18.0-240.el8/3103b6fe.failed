Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/3103b6fe.failed

If the driver is busy resetting queues after a change in
MTU or queue parameters, don't bother checking the link,
wait until the next watchdog cycle.
