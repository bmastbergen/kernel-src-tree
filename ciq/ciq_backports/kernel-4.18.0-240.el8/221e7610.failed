Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/221e7610.failed

Short circuit vmx_check_nested_events() if an unblocked IRQ/NMI/SMI is
pending and needs to be injected into L2, priority between coincident
events is not dependent on exiting behavior.
