Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/e995d512.failed

To avoid going to sleep only to get woken shortly thereafter, spin
briefly for new work upon completion of work.
