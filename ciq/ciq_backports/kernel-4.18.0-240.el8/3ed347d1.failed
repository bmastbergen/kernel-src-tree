Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/3ed347d1.failed

As described in "drm/i915/tc/icl: Implement TC cold sequences" users
of TC functions should held aux power well during access to avoid
read garbage due HW in TC cold state.

v3:
- renamed is_tc_cold_blocked() to assert_tc_cold_blocked()
- restored the removed 0xffffffff checks
