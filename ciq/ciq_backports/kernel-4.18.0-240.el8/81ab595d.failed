When a secure memslot is dropped, all the pages backed in the secure
device (aka really backed by secure memory by the Ultravisor)
should be paged out to a normal page. Previously, this was
achieved by triggering the page fault mechanism which is calling
kvmppc_svm_page_out() on each pages.

This can't work when hot unplugging a memory slot because the memory
slot is flagged as invalid and gfn_to_pfn() is then not trying to access
the page, so the page fault mechanism is not triggered.

Since the final goal is to make a call to kvmppc_svm_page_out() it seems
simpler to call directly instead of triggering such a mechanism. This
way kvmppc_uvmem_drop_pages() can be called even when hot unplugging a
memslot.

Since kvmppc_uvmem_drop_pages() is already holding kvm->arch.uvmem_lock,
the call to __kvmppc_svm_page_out() is made.  As
__kvmppc_svm_page_out needs the vma pointer to migrate the pages,
the VMA is fetched in a lazy way, to not trigger find_vma() all
the time. In addition, the mmap_sem is held in read mode during
that time, not in write mode since the virual memory layout is not
impacted, and kvm->arch.uvmem_lock prevents concurrent operation
on the secure device.
