Down-speed auto-negotiation may not always be enabled, in which case the
PHY won't down-shift to 100 or 10 during auto-negotiation.

This change enables downshift and configures the number of retries to
default 4 (which is also in the datasheet

The downshift control mechanism can also be controlled via the phy-tunable
interface (ETHTOOL_PHY_DOWNSHIFT control).

The change has been adapted from the Aquantia PHY driver.
