Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/18fc6c55.failed

Use l1_tsc_offset to compute svm->vcpu.arch.tsc_offset and
svm->vmcb->control.tsc_offset, instead of relying on hsave.
