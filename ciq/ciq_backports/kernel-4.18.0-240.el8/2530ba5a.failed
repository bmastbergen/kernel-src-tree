Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

It is possible (but unlikely) that FW was busy and missed a heartbeat
check but is still alive and will process the pending request, so don't
clean the dev_cmd in this case.  This occasionally occurs when working
with a card that is supporting many devices and is trying to shut them
all down at once, but still wants to see that last LIF disable request.
