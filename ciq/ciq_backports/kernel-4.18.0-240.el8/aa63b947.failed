Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/aa63b947.failed

Some bits of static data should have been made const from the start.
This change adds the const qualifier where appropriate.
