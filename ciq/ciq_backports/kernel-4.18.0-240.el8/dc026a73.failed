Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/dc026a73.failed

This is a preparation patch, it adds some helpers and makes
the next patches cleaner.

- extract io_impersonate_work() and io_assign_current_work()
- replace @next label with nested do-while
- move put_work() right after NULL'ing cur_work.
