Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/4ee7bda4.failed

Short circuit the cleanup if we get a timeout error from
ionic_qcq_disable() so as to not have to wait too long
on shutdown when we already know the FW is not responding.
