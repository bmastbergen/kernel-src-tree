Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f0b594df.failed

rwlock.h should not be included directly. Instead linux/splinlock.h
should be included. Including it directly will break the RT build.
