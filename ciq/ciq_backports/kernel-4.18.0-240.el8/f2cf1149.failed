Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f2cf1149.failed

After io_assign_current_work() of a linked work, it can be decided to
offloaded to another thread so doing io_wqe_enqueue(). However, until
next io_assign_current_work() it can be cancelled, that isn't handled.

Don't assign it, if it's not going to be executed.
