Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/4b514936.failed

When the netdev is down, the queues and their debug stats
do not exist, so don't try using a pointer to them when
when printing the ethtool stats.
