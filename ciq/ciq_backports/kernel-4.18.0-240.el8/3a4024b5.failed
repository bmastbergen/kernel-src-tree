Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/3a4024b5.failed

I consulted Cai Land(Chuntian.Cai@amd.com), he told me corresponding smc
message name to fSMC_MSG_SetWorkloadMask() is
"PPSMC_MSG_ActiveProcessNotify" in firmware code of Renoir.

Strange though it may seem, but it's a fact.
