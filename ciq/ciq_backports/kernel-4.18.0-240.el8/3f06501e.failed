Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/3f06501e.failed

Setting the prepared flag to false marks the streams for the
hw_params to be reset upon resuming. In the case of
the D0i3-compatible streams that ignored suspend to
keep the pipeline active in the DSP during suspend,
this should not be done.
