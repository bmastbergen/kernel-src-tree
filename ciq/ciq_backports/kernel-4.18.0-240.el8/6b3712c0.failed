Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/6b3712c0.failed

The set of entry->driver_removed is missing locking, protect it with
xa_lock() which is held by the only reader.

Otherwise readers may continue to see driver_removed = false after
rdma_user_mmap_entry_remove() returns and may continue to try and
establish new mmaps.
