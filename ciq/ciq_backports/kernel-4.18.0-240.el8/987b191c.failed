Set ethtool_ops->supported_coalesce_params to let
the core reject unsupported coalescing parameters.

This driver correctly rejects all unsupported parameters.
As a side effect of these changes the error code for
unsupported params changes from EINVAL to EOPNOTSUPP.

v3: adjust commit message for new error code and member name
