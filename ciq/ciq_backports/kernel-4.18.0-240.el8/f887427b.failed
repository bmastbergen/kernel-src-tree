Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f887427b.failed

Most of the tests run by fcnal-test.sh relies on the nettest command.
Rather than trying to cover all of the individual tests, check for the
binary only at the beginning.

Also removes the need for log_error which is undefined.
