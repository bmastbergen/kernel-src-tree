Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/3e19e6f3.failed

And inline mapping should never mark the page dirty and thus never end up
in writepages.  Add a check for that condition and warn if it happens.
