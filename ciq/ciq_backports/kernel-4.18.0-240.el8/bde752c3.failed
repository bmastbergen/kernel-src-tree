+ 		The Processor Utilization Resources Register (PURR) is
+ 		a 64-bit counter which provides an estimate of the
+ 		resources used by the CPU thread. The contents of this
+ 		register increases monotonically. This sysfs interface
+ 		exposes the number of PURR ticks for cpuX.

+ 		thread. The contents of this register increases
