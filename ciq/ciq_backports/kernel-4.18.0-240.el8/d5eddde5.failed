Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/d5eddde5.failed

Make sure the queue structures exist before trying
to delete them.  This addresses a couple of error
recovery issues.
