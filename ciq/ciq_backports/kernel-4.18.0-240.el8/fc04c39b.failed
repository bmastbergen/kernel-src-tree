Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/fc04c39b.failed

To cancel a work, io-wq sets IO_WQ_WORK_CANCEL and executes the
callback. However, IO_WQ_WORK_NO_CANCEL works will just execute and may
return next work, which will be ignored and lost.
