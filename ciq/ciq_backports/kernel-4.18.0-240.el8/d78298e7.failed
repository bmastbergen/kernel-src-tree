Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/d78298e7.failed

This little tweak restores the behaviour that was before the recent
io_worker_handle_work() optimisation patches. It makes the function do
cond_resched() and flush_signals() only if there is an actual work to
execute.
