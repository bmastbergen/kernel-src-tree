Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/eba6f5a3.failed

Export a helper to attach to an existing io-wq, rather than setting up
a new one. This is doable now that we have reference counted io_wq's.
