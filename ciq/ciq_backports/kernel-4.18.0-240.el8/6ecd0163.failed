Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/6ecd0163.failed

While initrd, elfcorehdr and backup regions are already added to the
reserve map, there are a few missing regions that need to be added to
the memory reserve map. Add them here. And now that all the changes to
load panic kernel are in place, claim likewise.
