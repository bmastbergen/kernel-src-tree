drm/i915/gt: Treat idling as a RPS downclock event

Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/21abf0bf.failed

If we park/unpark faster than we can respond to RPS events, we never
will process a downclock event after expiring a waitboost, and thus we
will forever restart the GPU at max clocks even if the workload switches
and doesn't justify full power.
