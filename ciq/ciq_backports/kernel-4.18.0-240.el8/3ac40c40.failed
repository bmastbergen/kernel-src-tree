Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/3ac40c40.failed

Clarify locking.rst to mention early that we're not enabling fast page
fault for indirect sps.  The previous wording is confusing, in that it
seems the proposed solution has been already implemented but it has not.
