+ 	  The Mellanox BlueField firmware implements functionality to
+ 	  request swapping the primary and alternate eMMC boot partition,
+ 	  and to set up a watchdog that can undo that swap if the system
+ 	  does not boot up correctly. This driver provides sysfs access
+ 	  to the userspace tools, to be used in conjunction with the eMMC
+ 	  device driver to do necessary initial swap of the boot partition.
