Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/3528cae9.failed

[Why]
For MST case: when update_config is called to disable a stream,
this clears the settings for all the streams on that link.
We should only clear the settings for the stream that was disabled.

[How]
Clear the settings after the call to remove display is called.
