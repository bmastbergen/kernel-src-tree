Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/05c47036.failed

This document is almost in ReST format. The only thing
needed is to mark a list as such and to add an extra
whitespace.

Yet, let's also use the standard document title markup,
as it makes easier if anyone wants later to add sessions
to it.
