Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/2293b419.failed

Deduplicate cancellation parts, as many of them looks the same, as do
e.g.
- io_wqe_cancel_cb_work() and io_wqe_cancel_work()
- io_wq_worker_cancel() and io_work_cancel()
