Even out Rx performance across MTU sizes by changing from full
skb allocations to page-based frag allocations.  The device
supports a form of scatter-gather in the Rx path, so we can
set up a number of pages for each descriptor, all of which are
easier to alloc and pass around than the standard kzalloc'd
buffer.  An skb is wrapped around the pages while processing
the received packets, and pages are recycled as needed, or
left alone if they weren't used in the Rx.
