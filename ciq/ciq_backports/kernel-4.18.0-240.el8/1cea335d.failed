Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/1cea335d.failed

bio completions can race when a page spans more than one file system
block.  Add a spinlock to synchronize marking the page uptodate.

Fixes: 9dc55f1389f9 ("iomap: add support for sub-pagesize buffered I/O without buffer heads")
