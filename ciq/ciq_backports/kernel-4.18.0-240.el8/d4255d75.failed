Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/d4255d75.failed

Add the set of info versions reported by each device driver, including
a description of what the version represents, and what modes (fixed,
running, stored) it reports.
