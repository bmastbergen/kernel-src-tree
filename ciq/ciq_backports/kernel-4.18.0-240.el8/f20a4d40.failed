Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

When running in a bond setup, or some other potential
configurations, the netdev mac may have been changed from
the default device mac.  Since the userland doesn't know
about the changes going on under the covers in a fw-upgrade
it doesn't know the re-push the mac filter.  The driver
needs to leave the netdev mac filter alone when rebuilding
after the fw-upgrade.
