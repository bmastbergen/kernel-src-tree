Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/6726ca1a.failed

of_get_regulator() will unconditionally add "-supply" to form the
property name. This is documented in commit 69511a452e6dc ("map consumer
regulator based on device tree"). Remove the suffix from the requests.
