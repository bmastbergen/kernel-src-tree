Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/9446e6fc.failed

The check cpu->hv_clock.system_time < 0 is redundant since system_time
is a u64 and hence can never be less than zero.  But what was actually
meant is to check that the result is positive, since kernel_ns and
v->kvm->arch.kvmclock_offset are both s64.
