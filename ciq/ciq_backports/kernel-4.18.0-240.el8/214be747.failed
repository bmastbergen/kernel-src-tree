This patch add introductions to thermal/power interfaces. They are
implemented as hwmon sysfs interfaces by thermal/power private
feature drivers.

+  Global error reporting management (errors/)
+      error reporting sysfs interfaces allow user to read errors detected by the
+      hardware, and clear the logged errors.
+ 
+  Power management (dfl_fme_power hwmon)
+      power management hwmon sysfs interfaces allow user to read power management
+      information (power consumption, thresholds, threshold status, limits, etc.)
+      and configure power thresholds for different throttling levels.

+  Thermal management (dfl_fme_thermal hwmon)
+      thermal management hwmon sysfs interfaces allow user to read thermal
+      management information (current temperature, thresholds, threshold status,
+      etc.).
