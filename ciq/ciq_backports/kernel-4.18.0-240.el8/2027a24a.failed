Page-merging of pages in memory-slots associated with a Secure VM
is disabled in H_SVM_PAGE_IN handler.

This operation should have been done the much earlier; the moment the VM
is initiated for secure-transition. Delaying this operation increases
the probability for those pages to acquire new references, making it
impossible to migrate those pages in H_SVM_PAGE_IN handler.

Disable page-migration in H_SVM_INIT_START handling.
