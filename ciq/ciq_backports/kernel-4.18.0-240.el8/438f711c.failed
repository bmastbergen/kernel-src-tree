Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/438f711c.failed

The comment used to say that kvm_get_hyp_vector is only called on VHE systems.
In fact, it is also called from the nVHE init function cpu_init_hyp_mode().
Fix the comment to stop confusing devs.
