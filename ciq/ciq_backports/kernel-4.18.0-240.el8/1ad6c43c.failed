When health reporters are not supported, recovery function is invoked
directly, not via devlink health reporters.

In this direct flow, the recover function input parameter was passed
incorrectly and is causing a kernel oops. This patch is fixing the input
parameter.

Following call trace is observed on rx error health reporting.
