Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f1b87ea8.failed

kvmppc_svm_page_out() will need to be called by kvmppc_uvmem_drop_pages()
so move it up earlier in this file.

Furthermore it will be interesting to call this function when already
holding the kvm->arch.uvmem_lock, so prefix the original function with __
and remove the locking in it, and introduce a wrapper which call that
function with the lock held.

There is no functional change.
