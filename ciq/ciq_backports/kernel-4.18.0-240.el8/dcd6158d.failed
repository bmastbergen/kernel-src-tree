Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/dcd6158d.failed

All callers pass AOP_FLAG_NOFS, so lift that flag to iomap_write_begin
to allow reusing the flags arguments for an internal flags namespace
soon.  Also remove the local index variable that is only used once.
