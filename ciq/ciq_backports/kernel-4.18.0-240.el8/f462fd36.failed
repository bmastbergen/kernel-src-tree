Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f462fd36.failed

When executing non-linked hashed work, io_worker_handle_work()
will lock-unlock wqe->lock to update hash, and then immediately
lock-unlock to get next work. Optimise this case and do
lock/unlock only once.
