Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/53121a7c.failed

This adds the missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() for SDIO IDs. While certain
platforms using this driver indeed have HW issues causing problems if
the module is loaded too early - this should be handled from user-space
by blacklisting it or delaying the loading.
