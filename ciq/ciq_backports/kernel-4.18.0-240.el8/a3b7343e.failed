Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/a3b7343e.failed

Firmware API changes which introduced 'num_elems' param in several probe
structs such as sof_ipc_probe_dma_add_params also impacted getter for
both, DMA and probe points. All struct handlers except for
sof_ipc_probe_info_params have been updated. Align said handler too to
calculate payload size correctly.
