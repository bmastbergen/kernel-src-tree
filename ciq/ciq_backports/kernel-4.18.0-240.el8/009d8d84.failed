Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

File systems like gfs2 don't support delayed allocations or unwritten
extents and thus allocate normal mapped blocks to fill holes.  To
cover the case of such file systems allocating new blocks to fill holes
also zero out mapped blocks with the new flag.
