Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/eea97b25.failed

Fix attribute name from "jtag_enable", which described twice to
"cpld3_version", which is expected to be instead of second appearance
of "jtag_enable".
