Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/2a8c2c1a.failed

Move the qcq debugfs add to the queue alloc, and likewise move
the debugfs delete to the queue free.  The LIF debugfs add
also needs to be moved, but the del is already in the LIF free.
