Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/aa47b540.failed

Rearrange the link_up/link_down messages so that we announce
link up when we first notice that the link is up when the
driver loads, and decouple the link_up/link_down messages from
the UP and DOWN netdev state.
