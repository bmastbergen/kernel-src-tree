Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/ca882609.failed

The ETF qdisc can queue skbs that it could not pace on the errqueue.

Address a few issues in the selftest

- recv buffer size was too small, and incorrectly calculated
- compared errno to ee_code instead of ee_errno
- missed invalid request error type

v2:
  - fix a few checkpatch --strict indentation warnings
