Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/1e8a6ce9.failed

Some drivers (e.g. sun4i-drm) need this info to decide whether they
need to enable dithering. Currently driver reports what panel supports
and if panel supports 8 we don't get dithering enabled.

Hardcode BPC to 6 for now since that's the only BPC
that driver supports.
