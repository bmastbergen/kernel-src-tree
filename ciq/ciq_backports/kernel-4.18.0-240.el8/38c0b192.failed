Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/38c0b192.failed

Similar to VMX, we need to leave the halted state when performing a vmexit.
Failure to do so will cause a hang after vmexit.
