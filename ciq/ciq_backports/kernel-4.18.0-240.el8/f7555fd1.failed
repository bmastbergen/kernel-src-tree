Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f7555fd1.failed

Update the devlink-health documentation to use the newer
ReStructuredText format.

Note that it's unclear what OOB stood for, and it has been left as-is
without a proper first-use expansion of the acronym.
