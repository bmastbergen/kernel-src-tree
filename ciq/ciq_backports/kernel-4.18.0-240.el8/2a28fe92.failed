Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/2a28fe92.failed

[Why]:
Renoir's pipe VM flags are not correctly updated if pipe strategy has
changed during some scenarios. It will result in watermarks mistakenly
calculation, thus underflow and garbage appear.

[How]:
Correctly update pipe VM flags to pipes which have been populated.
