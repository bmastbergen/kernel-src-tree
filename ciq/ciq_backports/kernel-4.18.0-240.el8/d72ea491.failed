The arch specific kernel module policy rule requires kernel modules to
be signed, either as an IMA signature, stored as an xattr, or as an
appended signature. As a result, kernel modules appended signatures
could be enforced without "sig_enforce" being set or reflected in
/sys/module/module/parameters/sig_enforce. This patch sets
"sig_enforce".
