Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Even with moving netif_tx_disable() to an earlier point when
taking down the queues for a reconfiguration, we still end
up with the occasional netdev watchdog Tx Timeout complaint.
The old method of using netif_trans_update() works fine for
queue 0, but has no effect on the remaining queues.  Using
netif_device_detach() allows us to signal to the watchdog to
ignore us for the moment.
