Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/6c0238c4.failed

Restoring the ASID from the hsave area on VMEXIT is wrong, because its
value depends on the handling of TLB flushes.  Just skipping the field in
copy_vmcb_control_area will do.
