Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/5dca69c4.failed

Replace the misguided "#pragma packed" with tags on each
struct/union definition that actually needs it.  This is safer
and more efficient on the various compilers and architectures.
