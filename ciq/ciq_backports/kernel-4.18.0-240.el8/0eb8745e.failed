Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/0eb8745e.failed

The tls_hw_* functions are quite confusingly named, since they
are related to the TOE-offload, not TLS_HW offload which doesn't
require TOE. Rename them.
