Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/30a1e6d0.failed

If the basic ionic interface works but the lif creation fails,
don't fail the probe.  This will allow us to use the driver to
help inspect the hw/fw/pci interface for debugging purposes.
