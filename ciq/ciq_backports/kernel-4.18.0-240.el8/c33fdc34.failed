Variable err is not uninitialized and hence can potentially contain
any garbage value.  This may cause an error when logical or'ing the
return values from the calls to functions crypto_aead_setauthsize or
crypto_aead_setkey.  Fix this by setting err to the return of
crypto_aead_setauthsize rather than or'ing in the return into the
uninitialized variable
