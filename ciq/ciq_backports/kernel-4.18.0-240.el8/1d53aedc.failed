Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/1d53aedc.failed

Make sure we can report the new FW version after a
fw-upgrade has finished by re-reading the device's
fw version information.
