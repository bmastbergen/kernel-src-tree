Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/f3bed7f8.failed

ct_policy and mpls_policy are parsed with nla_parse_nested(), which
does NL_VALIDATE_STRICT validation, strict_start_type is not needed
to set as it is actually trying to make some attributes parsed with
NL_VALIDATE_STRICT.

This patch is to remove it, and do the same on rtm_nh_policy which
is parsed by nlmsg_parse().
