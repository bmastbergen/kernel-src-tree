Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-240.el8/d05d5db8.failed

NAT test currently covers snat (masquerade) only.

Also add a dnat rule and then check that a connecting to the
to-be-dnated address will work.
