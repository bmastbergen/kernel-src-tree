Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

hardware_disable_test produces 512 snippets like
...
 main: [511] waiting semaphore
 run_test: [511] start vcpus
 run_test: [511] all threads launched
 main: [511] waiting 368us
 main: [511] killing child

and this doesn't have much value, let's print this info with pr_debug().
