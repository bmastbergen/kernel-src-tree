Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/9a52a574.failed

The sparse tool complains as follows

kernel/scftorture.c:124:1: warning:
 symbol '__pcpu_scope_scf_torture_rand' was not declared. Should it be static?

And this per-CPU variable is not used outside of scftorture.c,
so this commit marks it static.
