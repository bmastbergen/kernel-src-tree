mhi_power_down() does not ensure that the PM state is moved to an
inaccessible state soon enough as the system can encounter
scheduling delays till mhi_pm_disable_transition() gets called.
Additionally, if an MHI controller decides that the device is now
inaccessible and issues a power down, the register inaccessible
state is not maintained by moving from MHI_PM_LD_ERR_FATAL_DETECT
to MHI_PM_SHUTDOWN_PROCESS. This can result in bus errors if a
client driver attempted to read registers when powering down.
Close these gaps and avoid any race conditions to prevent such
activity.
