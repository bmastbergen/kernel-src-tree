Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/2d9c318b.failed

Since changeset 58ad30cf91f0 ("docs: fix reference to core-api/namespaces.rst"),
auto-references for chapters are generated. This is a nice feature, but
has a drawback: no chapters can have the same sumber.

So, we need to add two higher hierarchy chapters on this document,
in order to avoid such duplication.
