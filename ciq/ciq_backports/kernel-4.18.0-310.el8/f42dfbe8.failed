Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/f42dfbe8.failed

Client devices should use the APIs provided to allocate and free
the MHI controller structure. This will help ensure that the
structure is zero-initialized and there are no false positives
with respect to reading any values such as the serial number or
the OEM PK hash.
