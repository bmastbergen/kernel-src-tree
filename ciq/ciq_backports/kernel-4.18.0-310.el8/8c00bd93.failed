commit 8c00bd936f335461158dd50225ca8f2ea05a3717
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/8c00bd93.failed

Tell people that there now is an interface for querying pause frames.
A little bit of restructuring is needed given this is a first source
of such statistics.
