Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/dba3142b.failed

This commit summarizes the per-thread statistics, providing counts of
the number of single, many, and all calls, both no-wait and wait, and,
for the single case, the number where the target CPU was offline.
