Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/d9f23ea6.failed

If the IPA (IP hardware accelerator) is starved of event ring elements,
the modem is crashing (SDX55). That can be prevented by setting a
larger number of events (i.e 2 x number of channel ring elements).

Tested with FN980m module.
