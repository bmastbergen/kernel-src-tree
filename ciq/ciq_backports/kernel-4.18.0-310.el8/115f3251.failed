Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

With the current parsing of mhi_flags, the following statement always
return false:

eob = !!(flags & MHI_EOB);

This is due to the fact that 'enum mhi_flags' starts with index 0 and we
are using direct AND operation to extract each bit. Fix this by using
BIT() macros for defining the flags so that the reset of the code need not
be touched.
