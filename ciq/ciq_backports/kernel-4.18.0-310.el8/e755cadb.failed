This commit adds support for registering MHI client drivers with the
MHI stack. MHI client drivers binds to one or more MHI devices inorder
to sends and receive the upper-layer protocol packets like IP packets,
modem control messages, and diagnostics messages over MHI bus.

This is based on the patch submitted by Sujeev Dias:
