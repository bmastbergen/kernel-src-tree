This commit adds checks for memory misordering across calls to and
returns from smp_call_function_many() in the case where the caller waits.
Misordering results in a splat.

Note that in contrast to smp_call_function_single(), this code does not
test memory ordering into the handler in the no-wait case because none
of the handlers would be able to free the scf_check structure without
introducing heavy synchronization to work out which was last.
