Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/40c31271.failed

Current design allows a controller to register with MHI successfully
without the need to have any IRQs available for use. If no IRQs are
available, power up requests to MHI can fail after a successful
registration with MHI. Improve the design by checking for the number
of IRQs available sooner within the mhi_regsiter_controller() API as
it is required to be specified by the controller.
