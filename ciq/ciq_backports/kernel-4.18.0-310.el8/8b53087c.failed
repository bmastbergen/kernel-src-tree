Autonomous low power mode support requires the MHI host to resume from
multiple places and post a wakeup source to exit system suspend. This
needs to be done in a non-blocking manner. Introduce a helper API to
trigger the host resume for data transfers and other non-blocking use
cases while supporting implementation of autonomous low power modes.
