Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/b012ee6b.failed

In AER capable root complex, errors are reported to the host which
can then act accordingly and perform PCI recovering procedure.

This patch enables error reporting and implements error_detected,
slot_reset and resume callbacks.
