Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/2d501238.failed

In order to add an iteration -1 to indicate that the memory population
phase has not yet completed, convert the interations counters to ints.

No functional change intended.
