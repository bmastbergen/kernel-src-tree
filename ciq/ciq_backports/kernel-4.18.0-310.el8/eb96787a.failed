Hardware channels have a feature called burst mode that allows to
queue transfer ring element(s) (TRE) to a channel without ringing
the device doorbell. In that mode, the device is polling the channel
context for new elements. This reduces the frequency of host initiated
doorbells and increase throughput.

Create a new dedicated macro for hardware channels with burst enabled.
