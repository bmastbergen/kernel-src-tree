Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/f1b83973.failed

Don't bother mapping the Xen shinfo pages into the guest, they don't need
to be accessed using the GVAs and passing a define with "GPA" in the name
to addr_gva2hpa() is confusing.
