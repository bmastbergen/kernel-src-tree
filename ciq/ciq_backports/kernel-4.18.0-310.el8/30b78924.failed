Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/30b78924.failed

Devices that support RDDM do not require processing SYS_ERROR as it is
deemed redundant. Avoid SYS_ERROR processing if RDDM is supported by
the device.
