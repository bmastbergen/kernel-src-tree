Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/56c8ea86.failed

There is an extra 'i' counter in the mhi_firmware_copy() function
which is unused. Remove it to clean-up code and reduce stack
space as well as improve efficiency of the function.
