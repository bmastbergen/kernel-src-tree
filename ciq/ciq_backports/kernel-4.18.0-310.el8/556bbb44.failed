Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/556bbb44.failed

Currently, there exist a set of if...else statements in the
mhi_pm_disable_transition() function which make handling system
error and disable transitions differently complex. To make that
cleaner and facilitate differences in behavior, separate these
two transitions for MHI host.
