When setting up a device, we can krealloc the config->socks array to add
new sockets to the configuration.  However if we happen to get a IO
request in at this point even though we aren't setup we could hit a UAF,
as we deref config->socks without any locking, assuming that the
configuration was setup already and that ->socks is safe to access it as
we have a reference on the configuration.

But there's nothing really preventing IO from occurring at this point of
the device setup, we don't want to incur the overhead of a lock to
access ->socks when it will never change while the device is running.
To fix this UAF scenario simply freeze the queue if we are adding
sockets.  This will protect us from this particular case without adding
any additional overhead for the normal running case.
