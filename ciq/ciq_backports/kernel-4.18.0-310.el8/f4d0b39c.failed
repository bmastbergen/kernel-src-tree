Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/f4d0b39c.failed

Functions parse_ev_cfg() and parse_ch_cfg() access mhi_cntrl->mhi_dev
before it is set in function mhi_register_controller(),
use cntrl_dev instead of mhi_dev.
