Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/cd116318.failed

Move all the common code to generate TRE from mhi_queue_buf,
mhi_queue_dma and mhi_queue_skb to mhi_gen_tre. This helps
to centralize the TRE generation code which makes any future
bug fixing easier to manage in these APIs.
