Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/0c165b3c.failed

In order to support Xen SHUTDOWN_soft_reset (for guest kexec, etc.) the
VMM needs to be able to tear everything down and return the Xen features
to a clean slate.
