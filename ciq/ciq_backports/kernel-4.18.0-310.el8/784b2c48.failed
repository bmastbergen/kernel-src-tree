Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/784b2c48.failed

If the probe of the auxdrv failed, the device->driver is set to NULL.
During kernel shutdown, the bus shutdown will call auxdrv->shutdown and
cause an invalid ptr dereference. Add check to make sure device->driver is
not NULL before we proceed.
