Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/5aa93f05.failed

An MHI device is not necessarily associated with only channels as we can
have one associated with the controller itself. Hence, the chan_name
field within the mhi_device structure should instead be replaced with a
generic name to accurately reflect any type of MHI device.
