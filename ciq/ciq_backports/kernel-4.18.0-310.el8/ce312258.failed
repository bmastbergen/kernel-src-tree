Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/ce312258.failed

Powerdown is necessary if mhi_sync_power_up fails due to a timeout, to
clean up the resources.  Otherwise a BUG could be triggered when
attempting to clean up MSIs because the IRQ is still active from a
request_irq().
