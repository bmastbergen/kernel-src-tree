Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/5022b8ac.failed

This commit uses the scftorture.weight* kernel parameters to randomly
chooses between smp_call_function_single(), smp_call_function_many(),
and smp_call_function().  For each variant, it also randomly chooses
whether to invoke it synchronously (wait=1) or asynchronously (wait=0).
The percentage weighting for each option are dumped to the console log
(search for "scf_sel_dump").

This accumulates statistics, which a later commit will dump out at the
end of the run.
