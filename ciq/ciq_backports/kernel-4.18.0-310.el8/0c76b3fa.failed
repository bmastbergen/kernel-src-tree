Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

If an mhi_power_down() is initiated after the device has entered
RDDM and a status callback was provided for it, it is possible
that another BHI interrupt fires while waiting for the MHI
RESET to be cleared. If that happens, MHI host would have moved
a "disabled" execution environment and the check to allow sending
an RDDM status callback will pass when it is should not. Add a
check to see if MHI is in an active state before proceeding.
