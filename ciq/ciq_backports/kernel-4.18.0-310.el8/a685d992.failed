Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/a685d992.failed

For better or worse, the memslot APIs take the number of pages, not the
size in bytes.  The Xen tests need 2 pages, not 8192 pages.
