Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/9e66bf03.failed

On uniprocessor systems, smp_call_function() does nothing.  This commit
therefore avoids complaining about the lack of handler accesses in the
single-CPU case where there is no handler.
