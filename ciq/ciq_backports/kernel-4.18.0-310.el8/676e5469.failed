Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/676e5469.failed

This commit moves checking of the ->scfc_out field and the freeing of
the scf_check structure down below the end of switch statement, thus
saving a few lines of code.
