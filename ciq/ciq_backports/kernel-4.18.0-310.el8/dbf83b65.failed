Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/dbf83b65.failed

This commit prints error counts on the statistics line and also adds a
"!!!" if any of the counters are non-zero.  Allocation failures are
(somewhat) forgiven, but all other errors result in a "FAILURE" print
at the end of the test.
