Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

There is really no point having an auto-start for channels.
This is confusing for the device drivers, some have to enable the
channels, others don't have... and waste resources (e.g. pre allocated
buffers) that may never be used.

This is really up to the MHI device(channel) driver to manage the state
of its channels.

While at it, let's also remove the auto-start option from ath11k mhi
controller.
