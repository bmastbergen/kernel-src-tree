Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/e18d4e9f.failed

The MHI device may be in the syserr state when we attempt to init it in
power_up().  Since we have no local state, the handling is simple -
reset the device and wait for it to transition out of the reset state.
