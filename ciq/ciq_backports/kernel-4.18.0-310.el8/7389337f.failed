Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/7389337f.failed

Add support for system wide suspend/resume. During suspend, MHI
device controller must be put in M3 state and PCI bus in D3 state.

Add a recovery procedure allowing to reinitialize the device in case
of error during resume steps, which can happen if device loses power
(and so its context) while system suspend.
