Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/9b627c25.failed

There is double acquisition of the pm_lock from mhi_driver_remove()
function. Remove the read_lock_bh/read_unlock_bh calls for pm_lock
taken during a call to mhi_device_put() as the lock is acquired
within the function already. This will help avoid a potential
kernel panic.
