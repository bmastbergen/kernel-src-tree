Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/e0af24ac.failed

Kconfig coding style mandates use of tabs for the configuration
definition and an additional two spaces for the help text. Make the
required changes to the MHI Kconfig adhering to those guidelines.
