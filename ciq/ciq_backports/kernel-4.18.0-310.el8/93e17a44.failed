Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/93e17a44.failed

The bhie field in mhi_cntrl needs to be initialized to proper register
base in order to make mhi_rddm_prepare() to work. Otherwise,
mhi_rddm_prepare() will cause NULL pointer dereference.

Fixes: 6fdfdd27328c ("bus: mhi: core: Add support for downloading RDDM image during panic")
