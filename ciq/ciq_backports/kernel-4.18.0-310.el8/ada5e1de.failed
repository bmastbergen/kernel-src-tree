Driver continues handling of BHI interrupt even if MHI register access
is not allowed. By doing so it calls the status call back and performs
early notification for the MHI client. This is not needed when MHI
register access is not allowed. Hence skip the handling in this case and
return. Also add debug log to print device state, local EE and device EE
when reg access is valid.
