Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/f38173a7.failed

MHI channel, event and controller config data needs to be
treated read only information. Add const qualifier to make
sure config information passed by MHI controller is not
modified by MHI core driver.
