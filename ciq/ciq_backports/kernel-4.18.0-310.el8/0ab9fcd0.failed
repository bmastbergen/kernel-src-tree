Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/0ab9fcd0.failed

While writing any sequence or session identifiers, it is possible that
the host could write a zero value, whereas only non-zero values should
be supported writes to those registers. Ensure that the host does not
write a non-zero value for them and also log them in debug messages. A
macro is introduced to simplify this check and the existing checks are
also converted to use this macro.
