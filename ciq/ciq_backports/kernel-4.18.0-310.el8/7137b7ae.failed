Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:

Add a 2 byte pad to struct compat_vcpu_info so that the sum size of its
fields is actually 64 bytes.  The effective size without the padding is
also 64 bytes due to the compiler aligning evtchn_pending_sel to a 4-byte
boundary, but depending on compiler alignment is subtle and unnecessary.

Opportunistically replace spaces with tables in the other fields.
