The check to see if we have reset the device after detecting syserr at
power_up is inverted.  wait_for_event_timeout() returns 0 on failure,
and a positive value on success.  The check is looking for non-zero
as a failure, which is likely to incorrectly cause a device init failure
if syserr was detected at power_up.  Fix this.
