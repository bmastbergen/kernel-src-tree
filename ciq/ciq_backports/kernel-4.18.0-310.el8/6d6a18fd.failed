Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/6d6a18fd.failed

Even though one iteration is not enough for the dirty log performance
test (due to the cost of building page tables, zeroing memory etc.)
two is okay and it is the default.  Without this patch,
"./dirty_log_perf_test" without any further arguments fails.
