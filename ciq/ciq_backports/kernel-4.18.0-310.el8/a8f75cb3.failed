Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/a8f75cb3.failed

Instead of duplicating queuing procedure in mhi_queue_dma(),
mhi_queue_buf() and mhi_queue_skb(), add a new generic mhi_queue()
as common helper.

Note that the unified mhi_queue align pm_lock locking on mhi_queue_buf
behavior, taking it with irqsave variant (vs _bh for former queue_skb
and queue_dma version).
