Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/bc7ccce5.failed

Remove the system error worker thread and instead have the
execution environment worker handle that transition to serialize
processing and avoid any possible race conditions during
shutdown.
