While powering down, the device may or may not acknowledge an MHI
RESET issued by host for a graceful shutdown scenario and end up
sending an incoming data packet after tasklets have been killed.
If a rogue device sends this interrupt for a data transfer event
ring update, it can result in a tasklet getting scheduled while a
clean up is ongoing or has completed and cause access to freed
memory leading to a NULL pointer exception. Remove the interrupt
handlers for MHI event rings early on to avoid this scenario.
