This commit adds support for ringing channel and event ring doorbells
by MHI host. The MHI host can use the channel and event ring doorbells
for notifying the client device about processing transfer and event
rings which it has queued using MMIO registers.

This is based on the patch submitted by Sujeev Dias:
