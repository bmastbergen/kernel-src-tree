If MHI is unable to determine the execution environment during
the panic path, host must skip the RDDM download. This can happen
if the BHI offset read or the BHI_EXECENV register read fails
indicating that the underlying transport is unresponsive. Hence,
there is no need to trigger an RDDM using SYSERR or request an
SOC reset.
