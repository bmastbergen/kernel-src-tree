Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/b93e21a5.failed

This commit adds checks for memory misordering across calls to
smp_call_function_single() and also across returns in the case where
the caller waits.  Misordering results in a splat.
