In some cases, the entry of device to RDDM execution environment
can occur after a significant amount of time has elapsed and a
SYS_ERROR state change event has already arrived. This can result
in scenarios where MHI controller and client drivers are unaware
of the error state of the device. Remove the check for rddm_image
when processing the SYS_ERROR state change as it is present in
mhi_pm_sys_err_handler() already and prevent further activity
until the expected RDDM execution environment change occurs or
the controller driver decides further action.
