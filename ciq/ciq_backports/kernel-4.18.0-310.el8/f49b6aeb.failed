Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/f49b6aeb.failed

The ring element data, though being part of coherent memory, still need
to be performed before updating the ring context to point to this new
element. That can be guaranteed with a memory barrier (dma_wmb).
