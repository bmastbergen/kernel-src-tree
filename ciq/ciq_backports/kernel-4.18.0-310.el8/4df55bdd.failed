Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/4df55bdd.failed

This commit hoists much of the initialization of the scf_check
structure out of the switch statement, thus saving a few lines of code.
The initialization of the ->scfc_in field remains in each leg of the
switch statement in order to more heavily stress memory ordering.
