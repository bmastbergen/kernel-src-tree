Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/0d2bf11a.failed

For some reason, the original aux bus patch had some really long lines
in a few places, probably due to it being a very long-lived patch in
development by many different people.  Fix that up so that the two files
all have the same length lines and function formatting styles.
