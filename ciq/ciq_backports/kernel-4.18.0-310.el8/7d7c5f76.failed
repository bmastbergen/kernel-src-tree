Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/7d7c5f76.failed

When clearing the per-vCPU shared regions, set the return value to zero
to indicate success. This was causing spurious errors to be returned to
userspace on soft reset.

Also add a paranoid BUILD_BUG_ON() for compat structure compatibility.
