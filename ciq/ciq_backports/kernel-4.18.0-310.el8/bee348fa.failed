Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-310.el8/bee348fa.failed

There's no need to perform the shadow stack page accounting independently
of the lifetime of the underlying allocation, so call the accounting code
from the {alloc,free}() functions and simplify the code in the process.
