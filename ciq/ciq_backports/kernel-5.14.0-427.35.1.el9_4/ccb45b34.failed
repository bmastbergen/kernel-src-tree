Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-5.14.0-427.35.1.el9_4/ccb45b34.failed

The cpufreq code can be in a loadable module, so the architecture support
for it has to be exported:

ERROR: modpost: "acpi_arch_thermal_cpufreq_pctg" [drivers/acpi/processor.ko] undefined!
