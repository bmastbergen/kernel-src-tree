Rebuild_History Non-Buildable kernel-4.18.0-348.el8
commit-author Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
commit b693d0b372afb39432e1c49ad7b3454855bc6bed
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-4.18.0-348.el8/b693d0b3.failed

The documentation is in a format that is very close to ReST format.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fixing tables markups;
  - adding some lists markups;
  - marking literal blocks;
  - adjust some title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

-		ARM64 CPU Feature Registers
-		===========================
-
-Author: Suzuki K Poulose <suzuki.poulose@arm.com>
-
-
-This file describes the ABI for exporting the AArch64 CPU ID/feature
-registers to userspace. The availability of this ABI is advertised
-via the HWCAP_CPUID in HWCAPs.
-
-1. Motivation
----------------
-
-The ARM architecture defines a set of feature registers, which describe
-the capabilities of the CPU/system. Access to these system registers is
-restricted from EL0 and there is no reliable way for an application to
-extract this information to make better decisions at runtime. There is
-limited information available to the application via HWCAPs, however
-there are some issues with their usage.
-
- a) Any change to the HWCAPs requires an update to userspace (e.g libc)
-    to detect the new changes, which can take a long time to appear in
-    distributions. Exposing the registers allows applications to get the
-    information without requiring updates to the toolchains.
-
- b) Access to HWCAPs is sometimes limited (e.g prior to libc, or
-    when ld is initialised at startup time).
-
- c) HWCAPs cannot represent non-boolean information effectively. The
-    architecture defines a canonical format for representing features
-    in the ID registers; this is well defined and is capable of
-    representing all valid architecture variations.
-
-
-2. Requirements
------------------
-
- a) Safety :
-    Applications should be able to use the information provided by the
-    infrastructure to run safely across the system. This has greater
-    implications on a system with heterogeneous CPUs.
-    The infrastructure exports a value that is safe across all the
-    available CPU on the system.
-
-    e.g, If at least one CPU doesn't implement CRC32 instructions, while
-    others do, we should report that the CRC32 is not implemented.
-    Otherwise an application could crash when scheduled on the CPU
-    which doesn't support CRC32.
-
- b) Security :
-    Applications should only be able to receive information that is
-    relevant to the normal operation in userspace. Hence, some of the
-    fields are masked out(i.e, made invisible) and their values are set to
-    indicate the feature is 'not supported'. See Section 4 for the list
-    of visible features. Also, the kernel may manipulate the fields
-    based on what it supports. e.g, If FP is not supported by the
-    kernel, the values could indicate that the FP is not available
-    (even when the CPU provides it).
-
- c) Implementation Defined Features
-    The infrastructure doesn't expose any register which is
-    IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED as per ARMv8-A Architecture.
-
- d) CPU Identification :
-    MIDR_EL1 is exposed to help identify the processor. On a
-    heterogeneous system, this could be racy (just like getcpu()). The
-    process could be migrated to another CPU by the time it uses the
-    register value, unless the CPU affinity is set. Hence, there is no
-    guarantee that the value reflects the processor that it is
-    currently executing on. The REVIDR is not exposed due to this
-    constraint, as REVIDR makes sense only in conjunction with the
-    MIDR. Alternately, MIDR_EL1 and REVIDR_EL1 are exposed via sysfs
-    at:
-
-	/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$ID/regs/identification/
-	                                              \- midr
-	                                              \- revidr
-
-3. Implementation
---------------------
-
-The infrastructure is built on the emulation of the 'MRS' instruction.
-Accessing a restricted system register from an application generates an
-exception and ends up in SIGILL being delivered to the process.
-The infrastructure hooks into the exception handler and emulates the
-operation if the source belongs to the supported system register space.
-
-The infrastructure emulates only the following system register space:
-	Op0=3, Op1=0, CRn=0, CRm=0,4,5,6,7
-
-(See Table C5-6 'System instruction encodings for non-Debug System
-register accesses' in ARMv8 ARM DDI 0487A.h, for the list of
-registers).
-
-The following rules are applied to the value returned by the
-infrastructure:
-
- a) The value of an 'IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED' field is set to 0.
- b) The value of a reserved field is populated with the reserved
-    value as defined by the architecture.
- c) The value of a 'visible' field holds the system wide safe value
-    for the particular feature (except for MIDR_EL1, see section 4).
- d) All other fields (i.e, invisible fields) are set to indicate
-    the feature is missing (as defined by the architecture).

-ARM64 ELF hwcaps
-================
-
-This document describes the usage and semantics of the arm64 ELF hwcaps.
-
-
-1. Introduction
----------------
-
-Some hardware or software features are only available on some CPU
-implementations, and/or with certain kernel configurations, but have no
-architected discovery mechanism available to userspace code at EL0. The
-kernel exposes the presence of these features to userspace through a set
-of flags called hwcaps, exposed in the auxilliary vector.
-
-Userspace software can test for features by acquiring the AT_HWCAP entry
-of the auxilliary vector, and testing whether the relevant flags are
-set, e.g.
-
-bool floating_point_is_present(void)
-{
-	unsigned long hwcaps = getauxval(AT_HWCAP);
-	if (hwcaps & HWCAP_FP)
-		return true;
-
-	return false;
-}
-
-Where software relies on a feature described by a hwcap, it should check
-the relevant hwcap flag to verify that the feature is present before
-attempting to make use of the feature.
-
-Features cannot be probed reliably through other means. When a feature
-is not available, attempting to use it may result in unpredictable
-behaviour, and is not guaranteed to result in any reliable indication
-that the feature is unavailable, such as a SIGILL.
-
-
-2. Interpretation of hwcaps
----------------------------
-
-The majority of hwcaps are intended to indicate the presence of features
-which are described by architected ID registers inaccessible to
-userspace code at EL0. These hwcaps are defined in terms of ID register
-fields, and should be interpreted with reference to the definition of
-these fields in the ARM Architecture Reference Manual (ARM ARM).
-
-Such hwcaps are described below in the form:
-
-    Functionality implied by idreg.field == val.
-
-Such hwcaps indicate the availability of functionality that the ARM ARM
-defines as being present when idreg.field has value val, but do not
-indicate that idreg.field is precisely equal to val, nor do they
-indicate the absence of functionality implied by other values of
-idreg.field.
-
-Other hwcaps may indicate the presence of features which cannot be
-described by ID registers alone. These may be described without
-reference to ID registers, and may refer to other documentation.
-

+Memory Layout on AArch64 Linux
+==============================
+
+Author: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>
+
+This document describes the virtual memory layout used by the AArch64
+Linux kernel. The architecture allows up to 4 levels of translation
+tables with a 4KB page size and up to 3 levels with a 64KB page size.
+
+AArch64 Linux uses either 3 levels or 4 levels of translation tables
+with the 4KB page configuration, allowing 39-bit (512GB) or 48-bit
+(256TB) virtual addresses, respectively, for both user and kernel. With
+64KB pages, only 2 levels of translation tables, allowing 42-bit (4TB)
+virtual address, are used but the memory layout is the same.
+
+User addresses have bits 63:48 set to 0 while the kernel addresses have
+the same bits set to 1. TTBRx selection is given by bit 63 of the
+virtual address. The swapper_pg_dir contains only kernel (global)
+mappings while the user pgd contains only user (non-global) mappings.
+The swapper_pg_dir address is written to TTBR1 and never written to
+TTBR0.

-                Silicon Errata and Software Workarounds
-                =======================================
-
-Author: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>
-Date  : 27 November 2015
-
-It is an unfortunate fact of life that hardware is often produced with
-so-called "errata", which can cause it to deviate from the architecture
-under specific circumstances.  For hardware produced by ARM, these
-errata are broadly classified into the following categories:
-
-  Category A: A critical error without a viable workaround.
-  Category B: A significant or critical error with an acceptable
-              workaround.
-  Category C: A minor error that is not expected to occur under normal
-              operation.
-
-For more information, consult one of the "Software Developers Errata
-Notice" documents available on infocenter.arm.com (registration
-required).
-
-As far as Linux is concerned, Category B errata may require some special
-treatment in the operating system. For example, avoiding a particular
-sequence of code, or configuring the processor in a particular way. A
-less common situation may require similar actions in order to declassify
-a Category A erratum into a Category C erratum. These are collectively
-known as "software workarounds" and are only required in the minority of
-cases (e.g. those cases that both require a non-secure workaround *and*
-can be triggered by Linux).
-
-For software workarounds that may adversely impact systems unaffected by
-the erratum in question, a Kconfig entry is added under "Kernel
-Features" -> "ARM errata workarounds via the alternatives framework".
-These are enabled by default and patched in at runtime when an affected
-CPU is detected. For less-intrusive workarounds, a Kconfig option is not
-available and the code is structured (preferably with a comment) in such
-a way that the erratum will not be hit.
-
-This approach can make it slightly onerous to determine exactly which
-errata are worked around in an arbitrary kernel source tree, so this
-file acts as a registry of software workarounds in the Linux Kernel and
-will be updated when new workarounds are committed and backported to
-stable kernels.
