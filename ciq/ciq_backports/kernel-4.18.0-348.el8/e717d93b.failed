++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +	  ARMv8.4-TLBI provides TLBI invalidation instruction that apply to a
 +	  range of input addresses.
 +
 +	  The feature introduces new assembly instructions, and they were
 +	  support when binutils >= 2.30.
++=======
+ 	  E0PD (part of the ARMv8.5 extensions) allows us to ensure
+ 	  that EL0 accesses made via TTBR1 always fault in constant time,
+ 	  providing similar benefits to KASLR as those provided by KPTI, but
+ 	  with lower overhead and without disrupting legitimate access to
+ 	  kernel memory such as SPE.
+ 
+ 	  This option enables E0PD for TTBR1 where available.
