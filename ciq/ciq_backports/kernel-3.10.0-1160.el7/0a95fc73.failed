Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1160.el7/0a95fc73.failed

There's a new ALPS touchpad/pointstick combo device that requires
MT_CLS_WIN_8_DUAL to make its pointsitck work as a mouse.

The device can be found on HP ZBook 17 G5.
