Move the loading of certs from the UEFI MokListRT into a separate
routine to facilitate additional MokList functionality.

There is no visible functional change as a result of this patch.
Although the UEFI dbx certs are now loaded before the MokList certs,
they are loaded onto different key rings. So the order of the keys
on their respective key rings is the same.
