Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1160.el7/e231c687.failed

When locking the file in order to do O_DIRECT on it, we must unmap
any mmapped ranges on the pagecache so that we can flush out the
dirty data.
