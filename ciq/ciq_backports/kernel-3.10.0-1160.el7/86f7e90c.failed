KVM emulates UMIP on hardware that doesn't support it by setting the
'descriptor table exiting' VM-execution control and performing
instruction emulation. When running nested, this emulation is broken as
KVM refuses to emulate L2 instructions by default.

Correct this regression by allowing the emulation of descriptor table
instructions if L1 hasn't requested 'descriptor table exiting'.
