Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1160.el7/35a57134.failed

Consult the 'unconditional IO exiting' and 'use IO bitmaps' VM-execution
controls when checking instruction interception. If the 'use IO bitmaps'
VM-execution control is 1, check the instruction access against the IO
bitmaps to determine if the instruction causes a VM-exit.
