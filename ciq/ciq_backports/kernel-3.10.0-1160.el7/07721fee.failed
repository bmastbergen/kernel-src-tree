commit 07721feee46b4b248402133228235318199b05ec
Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1160.el7/07721fee.failed

vmx_check_intercept is not yet fully implemented. To avoid emulating
instructions disallowed by the L1 hypervisor, refuse to emulate
instructions by default.
