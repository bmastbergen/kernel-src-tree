Empty-Commit: Cherry-Pick Conflicts during history rebuild.
Will be included in final tarball splat. Ref for failed cherry-pick at:
ciq/ciq_backports/kernel-3.10.0-1160.el7/e71237d3.failed

Checks against the IO bitmap are useful for both instruction emulation
and VM-exit reflection. Refactor the IO bitmap checks into a helper
function.
