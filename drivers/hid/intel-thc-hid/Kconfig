	  THC (Touch Host Controller) is the name of the IP block in PCH that
	  interfaces with Touch Devices (ex: touchscreen, touchpad etc.). It
	  is comprised of 3 key functional blocks: A natively half-duplex
	  Quad I/O capable SPI master; a low latency I2C interface to support
	  HIDI2C compliant devices; a hardware sequencer with Read/Write DMA
	  capability to system memory.

	  Say Y/M here if you want to support Intel THC. If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Intel QuickSPI, based on Touch Host Controller (THC), implements
	  HIDSPI (HID over SPI) protocol. It configures THC to work at SPI
	  mode, and controls THC hardware sequencer to accelerate HIDSPI
	  transaction flow.

	  Say Y/M here if you want to support Intel QuickSPI. If unsure, say N.
