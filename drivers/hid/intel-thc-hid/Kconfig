	  THC (Touch Host Controller) is the name of the IP block in PCH that
	  interfaces with Touch Devices (ex: touchscreen, touchpad etc.). It
	  is comprised of 3 key functional blocks: A natively half-duplex
	  Quad I/O capable SPI master; a low latency I2C interface to support
	  HIDI2C compliant devices; a hardware sequencer with Read/Write DMA
	  capability to system memory.

	  Say Y/M here if you want to support Intel THC. If unsure, say N.
