config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_TRANSPORT
	bool
	help
	  This declares whether at least one SCMI transport has been configured.
	  Used to trigger a build bug when trying to build SCMI without any
	  configured transport.

config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_SHMEM
	bool
	help
	  This declares whether a shared memory based transport for SCMI is
	  available.

config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_MSG
	bool
	help
	  This declares whether a message passing based transport for SCMI is
	  available.

config ARM_SCMI_TRANSPORT_MAILBOX
	tristate "SCMI transport based on Mailbox"
	depends on MAILBOX
	select ARM_SCMI_HAVE_TRANSPORT
	select ARM_SCMI_HAVE_SHMEM
	default y
	help
	  Enable mailbox based transport for SCMI.

	  If you want the ARM SCMI PROTOCOL stack to include support for a
	  transport based on mailboxes, answer Y.
	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called scmi_transport_mailbox.

config ARM_SCMI_TRANSPORT_SMC
	tristate "SCMI transport based on SMC"
	depends on HAVE_ARM_SMCCC_DISCOVERY
	select ARM_SCMI_HAVE_TRANSPORT
	select ARM_SCMI_HAVE_SHMEM
	default y
	help
	  Enable SMC based transport for SCMI.

	  If you want the ARM SCMI PROTOCOL stack to include support for a
	  transport based on SMC, answer Y.
	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called scmi_transport_smc.

config ARM_SCMI_TRANSPORT_SMC_ATOMIC_ENABLE
	bool "Enable atomic mode support for SCMI SMC transport"
	depends on ARM_SCMI_TRANSPORT_SMC
	help
	  Enable support of atomic operation for SCMI SMC based transport.

	  If you want the SCMI SMC based transport to operate in atomic
	  mode, avoiding any kind of sleeping behaviour for selected
	  transactions on the TX path, answer Y.
	  Enabling atomic mode operations allows any SCMI driver using this
	  transport to optionally ask for atomic SCMI transactions and operate
	  in atomic context too, at the price of using a number of busy-waiting
	  primitives all over instead. If unsure say N.

config ARM_SCMI_TRANSPORT_OPTEE
	tristate "SCMI transport based on OP-TEE service"
	depends on OPTEE
	select ARM_SCMI_HAVE_TRANSPORT
	select ARM_SCMI_HAVE_SHMEM
	select ARM_SCMI_HAVE_MSG
	default y
	help
	  This enables the OP-TEE service based transport for SCMI.

	  If you want the ARM SCMI PROTOCOL stack to include support for a
	  transport based on OP-TEE SCMI service, answer Y.
	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called scmi_transport_optee.
