/*
 * Frequency meter - How fast is some event occurring?
 *
 * These routines manage a digitally filtered, constant time based,
 * event frequency meter.  There are four routines:
 *   fmeter_init() - initialize a frequency meter.
 *   fmeter_markevent() - called each time the event happens.
 *   fmeter_getrate() - returns the recent rate of such events.
 *   fmeter_update() - internal routine used to update fmeter.
 *
 * A common data structure is passed to each of these routines,
 * which is used to keep track of the state required to manage the
 * frequency meter and its digital filter.
 *
 * The filter works on the number of events marked per unit time.
 * The filter is single-pole low-pass recursive (IIR).  The time unit
 * is 1 second.  Arithmetic is done using 32-bit integers scaled to
 * simulate 3 decimal digits of precision (multiplied by 1000).
 *
 * With an FM_COEF of 933, and a time base of 1 second, the filter
 * has a half-life of 10 seconds, meaning that if the events quit
 * happening, then the rate returned from the fmeter_getrate()
 * will be cut in half each 10 seconds, until it converges to zero.
 *
 * It is not worth doing a real infinitely recursive filter.  If more
 * than FM_MAXTICKS ticks have elapsed since the last filter event,
 * just compute FM_MAXTICKS ticks worth, by which point the level
 * will be stable.
 *
 * Limit the count of unprocessed events to FM_MAXCNT, so as to avoid
 * arithmetic overflow in the fmeter_update() routine.
 *
 * Given the simple 32 bit integer arithmetic used, this meter works
 * best for reporting rates between one per millisecond (msec) and
 * one per 32 (approx) seconds.  At constant rates faster than one
 * per msec it maxes out at values just under 1,000,000.  At constant
 * rates between one per msec, and one per second it will stabilize
 * to a value N*1000, where N is the rate of events per second.
 * At constant rates between one per second and one per 32 seconds,
 * it will be choppy, moving up on the seconds that have an event,
 * and then decaying until the next event.  At rates slower than
 * about one in 32 seconds, it decays all the way back to zero between
 * each event.
